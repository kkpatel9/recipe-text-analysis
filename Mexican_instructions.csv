(if not using immediately, wrap and refrigerate). pour the oil into a deep, wide pan to a depth of 2 inches and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. i use a thermometer, or you can drop a bit of batter into the oil and it should rise up quickly surrounded by little bubbles. pat the fish dry with paper towels. check the thickness of the batter by dipping in one piece of the fish. the batter should be the consistency of medium-thick pancake batter, coating the fish easily but dripping very little. add a little beer if the batter seems too thick. add the fish to the batter. using tongs or chopsticks, swish each piece to make sure it is thoroughly coated, then lift out of the batter, let it drip once, and lay the fish gently into the hot oil. cook a few pieces at a time until they float and the batter is set but still very light in color. if a piece sticks to the bottom, leave it alone and it will release itself. remove the fish to a rack to drain; reserve the frying oil. (the fish can be prepared ahead to this point, cooled on a rack, and refrigerated uncovered. cool the oil and reserve). when you are ready to serve, reheat the oil to 350-360°f and refry the fish a few pieces at a time until crisp and golden brown. to serve, hold a tortilla in your hand and add a spoonful of guacamole. top with fish and squeeze lime over the whole thing. then add the secret sauce, salsa, shredded cabbage, cilantro and onion as desired."

"directions preparing the cornhusks. cover the husks with very hot water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable. preparing the filling: on a baking sheet, roast the tomatillos about 4 inches below a very hot broiler until soft (they’ll blacken in spots), about 5 minutes; flip them over and roast the other side. cool and transfer to a food processor or blender, along with all the delicious juice that has run onto the baking sheet. add the chiles and garlic and process to a smooth puree. heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium high. when quite hot, add the puree all at once and stir until noticeably thicker and darker, about 5 minutes.(i cover the pot with a splatter screen)  add 2 cups of the broth and simmer over medium heat (i use high heat)  until thick enough to coat a spoon quite heavily, at least 10 minutes. i keep it simmering while i shred the chicken. (if you are making a double batch of the recipe, make sure to cook the filling for a longer amount of time.) taste and season highly with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. stir in the chicken and cilantro; cool completely. preparing the batter: with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the lard or shortening with 2 teaspoons salt and the baking powder until light in texture, about 1 minute. continue beating as you add the masa (fresh or reconstituted) in three additions. reduce the speed to medium-low and add 1 cup of the remaining broth. continue beating for another minute or so, until a ½-teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light). beat in enough of the remaining ½ cup of broth to give the mixture the consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon. taste the batter and season with additional salt if you think it needs some. for the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so, then rebeat, adding a little more broth or water to bring the mixture to the soft consistency it had before. for forming the tamales, separate out 24 of the largest and most pliable husks—ones that are at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. if you can’t find enough good ones, overlap some of the large ones to give wide, sturdy surfaces to spread the batter on. pat the chosen husks dry with a towel. forming the tamales. cut twenty-four 8- to 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. one at a time, form the tamales: lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering end toward you. spread about ¼ cup of the batter into about a 4-inch square, leaving at least a 1 ½-inch border on the side toward you and a ¾-inch border along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). spoon about 1 ½ tablespoons of the filling down the center of the batter. pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause the batter to surround the filling). if the uncovered borders of the two long sides you’re holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if wide, roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (if the husk is small, you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.) finally, fold up the empty 1 ½-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed “bottom” leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strings or strips of husk around the tamal. as they’re made, stand the tamales on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. don’t tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. they need room to expand. setting up the steamer. steaming 24 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. to steam them all at once, you need something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in mexico or asian stack steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard cups in a large kettle. it is best to line the rack or upper part of the steamer with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with the steam and to add more flavor. make sure to leave tiny spaces between the husks so condensing steam can drain off. steaming and serving the tamales: when all the tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover cornhusks; if your husk-wrapped tamales don’t take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from falling over). set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for about 1 ¼ hours. (depending on the size of the tamales you make, it can take up to 4 hours). watch carefully that all the water doesn’t boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is necessary. tamales are done when the husk peels away from the masa easily. let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for a few minutes to firm up. for the best textured tamales, let them cool completely, then re-steam about 15 minutes to heat through."
