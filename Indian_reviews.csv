"so much great depth of flavor in this dish and i loved it! served it with basmati rice and naan! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 4 not exactly what i was looking for, but still pretty tasty.  i used whole coriander, and didn't care for the seeds/texture (my fault).  going to try this one again but adjust the spices a little.  if you can't find the paneer, an excellent substitute is mexican queso blanco (aka queso fresco) - the texture & taste is very similar. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sleepigrl reply 4 i made half a recipe for the two of us and it was great.  loved all the flavors and how they meld together.  i made homemade paneer recipe #207389 to use in the recipe.  served with recipe #277765, naan plus puppodums as an appetizer. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adopt a greyhound reply 3 fantastic recipe. i like this much better than our local indian restaurant's palak paneer. i think i added a little more cream because i had to warm it longer at the end (i could only find frozen paneer.) i used normal spinach leaves, and it made it stringy so next time i'll be sure to find the baby spinach. i feel about twenty pounds overweight from dinner, but fiance and i really loved this. thanks!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal spatchcock reply 3 i have tried 4 or 5 other recipes and found this is the best icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal wessberg reply 2"
"i really loved these samosas. very easy. not spicy, even with the jalapeno it called for, but a great flavor with the spice combo. i ended up having to use pre-formed frozen pie crust, which i defrosted and pulled out of the pie plate. a quick swipe with the rolling pin and it worked perfectly. they were easy to fold up with egg wash on all of the sides. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hollygolightly12 reply 1 delicious! i love samosas generally and i particularly like that these are oven baked. made for zwt8 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dreamer in ontario reply 1 i left our the jalepenos (kids) and used puff pastry.  i think the vegetable mix would freeze really well.  really tasty without being oily - a great recipe!  made for zwt8, the fearless red dragons icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookingpompom reply 1 wonderful recipe and really not that difficult to make. my family enjoyed these immensely. made for zwt7 for vivacious violets. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookingontheside reply 1 this is a really great recipe. it's quick, easy and an amazing substitute for the real deal. we don't have access to indian food anymore, so i have to resort to actually cooking it myself. i will definitely be making this again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef katlily reply 1"
"i made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out delicious. these would be great with a chutney! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 recipe worked well as written. thanks for sharing it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal busy student reply i used a combination of white and wheat flour for the gram but followed the rest as written.  very good.  served with recipe #159238 and recipe #63446. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adopt a greyhound reply i'm a bit of a novice bhaji maker, but i was very pleased with these (and my chilli loving husband even more so!)

i was a little short on fresh coriander so had to make up the difference with bottled, but otherwise, these were perfect!

i thought dh might be sharing them with his friends, but no.. :d

i was very pleased with this  straightforward recipe and will undoubtedly be making them again, thanks, brian! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen elizabeth reply how easy are these to make? answer-very easy!! i used ready chopped coriander from a tube ( don't cringe brian!) as my plant is lacking in leaves at the moment,and i like to have it as a back up.it worked just fine,and added plenty of flavour.my homegrown cayenne chillies added a good kick of heat to them.they were delicious!!!! my husband is the bhaji fanatic,and he gave thumbs up,so i thank you brian for a fab recipe,i think i shall be cooking these a lot!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal noo8820 reply"

"well, well, well..i would never have thought that this would be so tasty...i can see why you used 1/2 the amount of cumin...it is very dominate...but that's ok in my book cuz i love it...but using a full tsp would have been way too much...so if you aren't a huge fan i would use 1/4 tsp...i wanted to lower the sugar content so i used splenda with great results...i wasn't sure what to do with the ginger...i just smashed it with a knife...but after it came to a boil it seemed to want to sit in the bottom of the pan... so when i poured it into a container after it cooled it  was left in the bottom so that's where it stayed...now i wonder if i made sure it when into the container if it would have had more ginger taste to it...i will give that a try next time...i had no mint but i bet it would have made a nice garnish...thanks for posting...i can't wait to try this on my friends and family...:) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teresas reply 2 super refreshing and a great twist on lemonade. the flavor was amazing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply this was a surprise beverage for me!  i used only 1/4 tsp of cumin and left the ginger in. thanks for another different cocktail (i think it would be fantastic with gin or vodka!) made for zwt 8. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sjkotylak reply"
"i love this recipe! it was worth all the steps, and can't wait to make it again. served it with rice and homemade naan for a complete meal! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 substitute the cream with plain non fat yogurt - greek will work too. cream does not belong in indian dishes. a culinary travesty in all indian restaurant in the us, sadly ?? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal christina a. reply 1 i just love tikka masala but have never been brave enough to try it at home.. but this wasnt too hard and it was better i think than local take-out icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gingerlyj reply 1 an exceptional restaurant quality dish and worth the trouble.   i doubled the recipe and forgot purchase a second pepper.  i?m not sure how hot it would have been had i not doubled up; however, it came out great adding a few tablespoons of crushed red peppers.  the flavors were even better after the sauce set up overnight. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephen p. reply"
"turned out really well, used half whole wheat flour and half white. found that the ones that were rolled thinner puffed up better. thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lil_miss_sbc reply 10 beware making these--you will gobble them all up, make more, and eat those too.  these are so good.  easy to make, too, though a little time consuming.  i flatten mine out in a tortilla press.  i found the flatter, the better.  getting them paper thin to the point of nearly tearing gave them those puffy little pockets like restaurant naan.  i've used store-bought yogurt as well as homemade nonfat yogurt, and both work well. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jujubegirl reply 10 i used whole wheat pastry flour and nonfat plain yogurt. i also added two teaspoons of turmeric for color and flavor, divided the dough into 16 small rounds, and brushed the finished product with melted garlic butter and indian spices. they were amazing! chewy, crisp, light, and puffy. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal homefrymama reply 8 this recipe is so good and so simple. if i don't want to use the oven, i have used a frying pan to cook both sides and it turns out just fine. i even use this bread instead of hamburger buns. it tastes especially good with curried pork burgers #431629 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal edeneve reply 6 this recipe is awesome!!  for those who commented that this naan is not as good as their fav restaurant, i am sorry.  this is every bit as good if made according to the specific instructions.  when rolled out very thin, they puff up and get nice and brown.  i did brush with the melted butter and that is even better!!  next time i will try adding some whole wheat flour just to see if the end result is just as good but healthier. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal annroberts54 reply 4"

"i just tried out this recipe this weekend for my friends and they loved it, but i didn't make 9 cups of rice i added exactly half of that and it turned out fantastic every body enjoyed it and i thought its awesome... thank you for the great recipe :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hutamk reply 4 it was ,no doubt, the best biryani ever. it just had the taste of a restaurant biryani. the meat was completely tender and i disagree with everyone who thinks the rice quantity was more, because it turned out to be perfect for me. please post some more recipes of different kinds of biryani. thanks a lot.. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal anum qazi reply 4 made this twice now and this go around was way better than the last. i too observed that there was way too much rice..insanely so. this time it was closer to reality. what i discovered is 7 cups, a whole bag of trader joe's basmati rice was a correct portion for a heavy on the meat ratio. it probably would have been what the original recipe called for. previously i used a different rice and it was way too much. the rice type makes a difference on volume! second, i thought more yogurt, about 1/2 cup was a good choice. i also was concerned about spacey heat with young children so i changed out the usual jalepeno for these weird, milder wrinkled up long green chilis. a mild yellow chili might also work. i used golden raisens instead of prunes to good effect. i would like to use sliced almonds in the future as it calls for it in a good biryani. to make a healthier meal we used organic free range venison and elk for the meat instead of a high fat lamb or goat. it is an excellent change out and usually people comment how mild and lean the lamb is...until we tell them it's free range organic venison. it gets oohs and ahs from the taste-testers. i'm still working on the perfect raita (yogurt sauce) for this dish but it requires additional experimentation. overall, this is a grear recipe that doesn't require obscure desi ingredients. everything in the recipe is available at most grocers. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal troy m. reply 2 tasty recipe, too much rice however. i (like others here) would suggest using quarter of the amount suggested. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal andrew s. reply 2 see 1 reply for best biryani, meat is always more than rice. if rice is 1 kg meat should be 1 and half kg or may be a little more. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rabi n. reply 1"

"oh charishma! i was so happy when i found this recipe here! like your dad, my husband is also very fond of jalebis. wow, i thought to myself....now i can make them any time without having to wait overnight for the batter to rise! i made them for breakfast today. they looked like jalebis but unfortunately did not quite taste like the authentic ones. also, after putting them in the syrup, they turned limp within seconds. this does not happen when i use fermented batter. i followed the recipe exactly as you stated. do yours come out like the ones available in the market? perhaps, i needed to ferment the batter, after all? i will make them again but the next time, i will add less water and more yogurt. watch this space...i'll come back and tell you how it turned out!! update : and i'm back! about 36 hours later, i made some more jalebis out of the left over batter. and this time they were perfect!!! they were crisp and yummy, with a hint of the fermentation taste, and my husband loved it! hmmm, so the batter did need to ferment....:) after having sampled today's lot, your recipe definitely rates a 4 star and not the 3 that i gave you earlier!! sorry about that, but at that time, it just didn't taste right:( but now i'm going to be making it often....just will let the batter sit for atleast 5 hours before i make the jalebis. thank you for posting the recipe.

"i'm indian and have had kulfi in india, and here in the states too many times to count. this recipe is excellent and is as close as you can get (if not exact) to real kulfi from idian restaurants... and it's super easy! (just fyi, it's supposed to be a little icy and hard, and not creamy like vanilla ice cream). for the ""other flavoring"", if you want to make ""elachi kulfi"", use the seeds from dried green cardamom (""elaichi"").  grind about 10 cardamom pods worth of seeds (without the shell) using a mortar and pestle to near powder and mix all the grounds in if using popsicle molds. i, on the other hand, just used a 9x13 casserole dish and cut into squares when the kulfi set. if you're doing it like this, take half of cardamom grounds and mix that into the liquid. then sprinkle the rest on top so they float. you can also sprinkle on pistachio grounds as well. very authentic! thanks spatchcock! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tkochhar reply 2 i didn't have the right ramekins so i used what i had, but they still turned out delicious. followed the recipe exactly and it was so easy to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 i made this tonight because i love kulfi. i tweaked the recipe as follows: for a first test run i only made half the recipe. to that, i added the slice of bread another reviewer recommended as well as pistachios (about a handful) and lots of freshly ground cardamom (about 20 pods). this came out beautiful and just like the best kulfis i have had at indian restaurants. i will definifetly be making this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chefemma reply 1 one word: fabulous! this is quite versatile-- and if you want to make different flavors, can easily split up the milk mixture to different bowls to flavor with different extracts and seasonings. i did one large batch with regular evaporated milk, regular scm, and half & half and flavored with 2 tsp vanilla and a few shakes of cardamom. i froze them in two sets of 6 ikea pop molds and had leftover which fit into 5 more silicon cupcake molds-- and found i liked them better because they're easier to extract and don't require sitting in hot water. next time, i will make these by placing the silicon cupcake ""papers"" in a cupcake pan then freeze the entire thing-- and maybe add cocoa powder or chocolate extract, perhaps some shredded coconut and almonds! thanks for a fast, easy, and inexpensive summer treat! (edit: i forgot to add it in my original review, freezing in the cupcake molds only takes about 4 hours to freeze.) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal the80srule reply 1 this is how i make it with one addition: i add a slice of white bread (crusts removed) and i whiz everything together in a blender. you can add pistachios while blending . 
the bread gives the kulfi a graininess that originally kulfi is supposed to have. 
also - cardamom is part of the original recipe. you can either ad d in the cardamom seeds while blending or mix them in when freezing.

"these were the perfect blend of sweetness and slightly savory thanks to the pistachios i added. not too sweet. they didn't last long in my house. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply tastes delightful! i added saffron threads and some chopped pistachios, too. 

the only reason why i give this recipe 3 stars instead of 5 is because the directions are not very specific on:

1.) time requirements on each step

2.) measurement of nuts

3.) the fact that my burfi turned into more of a gooey fudge after setting than a solid fudge (as i have always associated burfi with from past experiences)

perhaps you can give a few guidelines on approximate times for steps 3, 4, and 8. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lerandia reply oh this is sooo good! i added chopped almonds, some cardomom,and saffron...my eyes rolled to the back of my head too! do the ""girls"" have any other recipes...please post them! thanks for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal luv4food reply this burfi is delicious! it set up fine for me. i sprinkled powdered cardamon and chopped cashews over the top while it was still hot then cut into squares after it cooled. my teenage son loves it too. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hhollyd reply i must have done something wrong if everyone else is raving about this but it was awful. i followed the instructions exactly but my milk would not de lump so i ended up getting my hand blender and smoothing it out then it started burning before it got too thick and it never quite firmed up to fudge texture it was more of a grainy carmel? i have never heard of burfi brfore so maybe i just dont like it i added a pinch of cardamom too. i think it needed vanilla? anyway we each took one bite and tossed it in the garbage. it was really grainy too. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sprue reply"

"this recipe was amazing.  i had a chef over for dinner and her 2 foodies and they licked their plates clean.  out of this world.  because i didn't have time to marinate the chicken, i baked it in a covered baking pot in all it's ingredients adding onions sliced round on top. i used 4 skinless chicken breasts and sliced them in half & tenderized them a bit with a mallet.  i put all of the ingredients of the marinade in the pot with the chicken and while the oven heated up - it sat soaking in those yummy juices for about 30 minutes.  then i cooked it at 450 for 30 minutes then turned each piece over and cooked it for another 20 - 30 minutes.  took it out and as my guests arrived, i guess it sat in the pot in it's juices for another hour.  to go along with the chicken i made saag and a mint chutney and heated up whole wheat pita.  my chef friend made a dill cucumber yogurt salad with baby tomatoes that was the perfect addition to the meal.  we were stuffed after 1 helping. i can't wait to make this meal again.  thanks for posting it and for everyone's person renditions. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal apsheri reply 5 oh boy did this e-x-c-i-t-e! have this for night! bought some tandoori colouring when last time in spice shop, i could go on about the colouring (which is wonderful) but will stop lol 
this is the best it can be!
what an authentic dish this was to me!
added less than 1/4 teaspoon tandoori colouring, true!
i have read can simply add a drop or two of red food colouring dye too!
ok, i used chicken tenders, worked for me!
initially heated oven to 220c, then lowered it to 200, as was instinctual for me!
watch it slightly char, was lovely too!
when i turned them over, i reapplied what was left of the marinated too!
lowered oven to 180c, cooked for ten minutes, rested for 30,
worked perfect!!! absolutley perfect for me!
think the key is making sure whatever chicken you use, don't dry it out!
as this is a great recipe i certainly do shout!!! lol
thanks!

slices of red onion, lemon juice...yumberini whoo hoo! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mickeydownunder reply 4 hi all

so i'm very sad to say that after purchasing all the spices for this dish, it was a big let down. the recipe tastes wonderful, if you're interested in taco flavored chicken. i should have searched a few recipes, as now i've realized this recipe is missing all the flavors that make an indian dish authentic. where is the garam masala? the turmeric? the curry? anything? all i tasted in this dish was cumin and although i love the flavor, i definitely was expecting something else. look up other recipes and you will see the color is even missing from this dish. i will have to try again. once again- tastes good- not indian authentic good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal samantha f. reply 2 see 1 reply lovely!<br/><br/>i made a few modifications, which is normal for me. i tripled the amount of cayenne pepper, doubled the black pepper, quadrupled the paprika, and quadrupled the garlic. used about double the chilli paste. (we like spiced up stuff in this house.) used water buffalo curd instead of yoghurt - very similar dairy product, but the wb curd is thicker.  didn't have ginger *gasp!*, so that was omitted. used about 1/2 to 2/3 the chicken and added chunks of potatoes and onions, all smothered in the yoghurt sauce. didn't have time to marinade, so tossed all of it in a baking dish, so the chicken was not suspended, but rather sat in all the sauce along with everything else. baked it for a bit over an hour, turning and stirring in between.<br/><br/>love love love love love it. will definitely make this again. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lmashton reply 2 i joined food.com just so i could review this recipe.  simply the recipe is amazing.  excellent blend of flavors, easy to prepare and authentic tasting. thank you jewelerbytradechefwannabe!!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tom_mullen777 reply 1"

i substituted the serrano chillies with green chillies as i dont use serrano chillies, and i used 1 1/2 cups more of water as 2/3 cup was falling short to cook the potaotes in. i dont have brown mustard seeds, so i used black ones instead. it was lovely and fantastic and will be a regular on our table. thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal charishma_ramchandani reply 10 good stuff.  i was afraid to add the cayenne as well as the serrano chile.  i'm norwegian, not indian!  it came out great as a main dish for a meal that included a butternut squash casserole (modified with less sugar). #4100  i plan to use this recipe again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dr. paul reply 5 mmmmmm, very good sue! like charishma, i used a green chili and black mustard seeds, and added 1/2 cup water (i scaled down to 1 serving). i also substituted black pepper for cayenne. i added the water in batches, and since the potatoes seemed to be taking quite a while to cook, i covered the skillet after a while, leaving a small gap for steam to escape, and they cooked much faster this way, and were ""sookhi"" (dry) as well. thanks for this one; next time i'll make it for the whole family! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal anu_n reply 5 really delicious! the potatoes and peppers are the perfect combo icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ivansocal reply i agree with the reviewers who said this recipe has authentic flavors, the spicing is very similar to that used by various friends i have had from south asian countries. i really loved the taste of the cumin seed (which tasted even better after settling for awhile and eating the leftovers). i think i would like this even more if i substituted some of the potato for sweet potato or carrot and added some peas or green beans. the only slight modifications i made was to use two chopped green chillies and to fry the seeds then the onion and chilies in a little bit of olive oil before adding the potatoes, spices and water. thank you for this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zainab23 reply"
"i think this is a great starting point for trying some different modifications.

i suggest using all milk (total 3.5 cups) and steeped everything in that for a creamier experience that less resembles just black tea with milk. also, like this it becomes a one step process -- everything goes in the pot together, just put on high heat and then pull the pot off as soon as you notice a slight boil. stir near continuously. steep time is similar.

also doubled the cardamom and peppercorn and added a little anise and a 3-4 coffee beans. used a coffee grinder to break everything up. used a potent loose leaf assam. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jhwilliams reply 3 see 1 reply i can't stress enough how much homemade chai is so much better than the tea in stores! there's so much more flavor! i highly recommend this, especially on cold nights. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 this is a good start and the right ingredients for regular chai. i would add a couple of suggestions. use half n half creamer instead of regular milk. you need to add masala spice mix for it to be masala chai. i've never seen decaf tea used for chai anywhere in india, sri lanka, or bangladesh. you must be careful to boil the creamer only a few seconds or it will scald. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jindypadgett reply 2 see 1 reply brilliant! a quick suggestion - using coarsely powdered dry (dehydrated) ginger instead of fresh ginger would impart a very wholesome spicy flavour. magically clears blocked sinuses and soothes the throat as well. <br/>replace 1/4 tsp fresh ginger with 1/8 tsp (or a pinch) of dry ginger. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal theenchantedone reply 2 i cannot thank you enough for this recipe. the irony is i am an indian and always struggled to make that perfect cuppa all these years! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal divi k. reply 1 see 1 reply"
"i am re-reviewing this as i have learned some things that are worth sharing: 1) it is okay to substitute another oil for the peanut.  i don't think you'll notice a big difference and it may save you some cash.  also, i turned this into a one-skillet dish and it is a little faster to cook and less mess.  i added all the oil (i used shortening) at the beginning and then added the chicken after the shallot/onion mixture was translucent.  i added extra garam masala and cayenne to make up for the missed chicken browning step.  this yielded the same delicious dish that the two skillet method did.  also, i simmered the final product on medium low for an extra 10 or 15 minutes and it thickened up nicely and did not need cornstarch.  also, i added a half cup or so of chopped cilantro.  thanks - my husband and i love this wonderful dish.  served with basmati and flat bread. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal wcramer06 reply 17 great recipe! i substituted sour cream for yogurt and made my own garlic-ginger paste out of ground ginger, fresh garlic, and olive oil. and made a curry rice as a side dish. the sauce was creamy and the spice combination was perfect. thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephen b. reply 5 absolutely one of the best recipes i have tried.  taste just like the local indian restaurant we have in our area.  it was quick and easy  i didn't have ginger paste; however, i did use about a tablespoon of powdered ginger. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal coneathea_11171011 reply 4 some of the best butter chicken i've ever eaten! i recommend removing from the heat, stirring in the half and half and yogurt and then returning to the heat...this way it won't curdle. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 my boyfriend and i made this tonight for the second time, and it turned out great. i made a few deviations from the exact recipe because i didn't have things like peanut oil or ginger-garlic paste but i, like other reviewers, also made it into a one dish recipe by browning the chicken with the onions. i didn't have cayenne pepper but i used smoked paprika instead and i think it gave the dish a great flavor.<br/>we served it over basmati rice and both of us finished this, even though it was supposed to be 4 servings. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal the tiny chef reply 3"
"amazing!!!
changes i made (suggest)
-fresh garlic (3 cloves)
- 1/2 to 1tsp smoked paprika
-use thighs not breast

best way to cook:
-cook over highest heat setting on bbq just to char each side
-then cook using indirect heat for about 30+ minutes... closest thing to a tandoor oven taste!

enjoy this great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal roccobertuzzi reply 4 yum! made this using skinless boneless chicken breasts tonight on the george foreman and it turned out wonderful. i used fresh garlic and ginger, 2 thai bird chiles instead and no turmeric because i didn't have any.  i also didn't need to oil the grill, which made this recipe even healthier. thanks for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal peko3517 reply 3 a family favorite!! i omit the jalepenos & put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to get it nice & crisp. also add red food coloring (to the marinade) to give it a beautiful red color. thanks for the awesome recipe!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal misty cooks reply 2 this was absolutely fantastic! i let the chicken marinate for 5 hours and it still came out very flavourful and tasty. i did not find it spicy, but am sure that the heat will increase the longer you let it marinate. i added a bit of salt on top of the chicken just before placing in oven (saw review that recommended more salt) and i am glad i did. i used chicken legs. it will definitely not be the last time i make this; served it with recipe #386629,  recipe #386629 and recipe #397595 - we had an indian feast! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal deantini reply 2 my husband and i love this recipe!  i use fat-free greek yogurt and it sticks to the chicken so well. we tried it on pork tenderloin last night as well with equally great results!  thanks so much for sharing :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal baking carly reply 2"
"i've tried many different roti/chappati recipes and i think i'm sold on this one.  it's really easy to work with, nice and soft unlike other variations i've tried.  i used light spelt flour and soy milk and things worked out really well.  i didn't have time to let it sit, but will certainly do that next time.  thanks very much for a great recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal magpie diner reply 1 this was my first attempt at any kind of indian bread & i was very pleased with the results. i used a cast-iron pan & followed your excellent instructions to a t. thank you so much for the time you took posting this! recommended! (^o^) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mellowpuff reply 1 i've been making chappatis for years but this is the first time i've added milk to the dough. earlier, i used to use clarified butter to knead the dough and for frying, so the oil and butter were changes too. instead of rolling it out in a circle, i rolled it out in a square shape for a different look. if you're going with the circular shape, just remember to keep the pressure light as you roll out the dough and, with practice, you'll find the dough goes in a circle on its own. while frying, after flipping it once, i applied a little pressure at various points on the roti (concentrate on the edges) with a spoon or thin spatula to help it puff up a little. for those of you who are hesitating to try this recipe based on the long set of instructions... it's lengthy only because rani has taken the time and effort to give very detailed instructions for those who have never tried making this flat bread before, and i must say the procedure is explained in perfect detail. follow them to a t and it'll be really difficult to mess up. once you get the hang of it, making rotis will be as easy as 1-2-3. these go very well with any indian curry (i've served it with recipe #72321). or just eat them plain! my 10 year old cousin loves it that way. ty for posting rani. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal galley devil reply 1 great! time-consuming, but worth it. the recipe doesn't say when to add the milk, so i added it after the water. i also needed considerably more flour than the recipe called for to make it workable. still, they're great, and we'll definitely make them again. we served them with chicken tikka masala (#25587)and aloo matar ka pulao (#172775).
**update** i made these again, this time leaving out the milk altogether. i think they were better without it! i also didn't need any extra flour without the milk. i've changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars after this experiment. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sweetpeanc reply 1 i would love to make roti again. i need to purchase an electric counter top burner to do this.

although, i used a variation for the amchoor and added extra tomato. it was the very best recipe  that i have ever found.

variations:
1) we used jared ""home packed"" tomatos and added 1 cup (16 tablespoons, whole roma chopped ""no liquid"" and strained into a measuring cup until all the extra juice was extracted ""about 40 minutes"")

2)1 cup of the strained tomato liquid was used instead of the water. add extra liquid if required. water or juice.

"leave the eggs whole. my auntie used to make this for me all the time when i was younger. it was delicious! also, do not drain the canned tomatoes. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kkmeemu reply i really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work for me.  there's just way too much onion in the dish and not enough liquid, so you're just left with eggs with cooked chopped onions on top.  the spices should probably be cut in half too, as there's just not enough sauce at the end...  i even doubled the water and used 1-1/2 onions instead of two.  it's a shame, because the spice mixture and the egg really tasted like it could go well together in smaller quantities and in a more watery curry sauce.  maybe a can of tomatoe sauce instead of tomato paste would help, but i don't think the extra acidity would work in this dish. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rpgaymer reply it smelled really good as i was cooking it, but wasn't quite as good as the scent.  i did add the peas, and i did have the eggs only cut in half (but ended up cutting them into smaller pieces on my plate when eating it). i found it much too dry; i added a half cup of water to the simmering pan, and still think it could have used a little more. i agree with others that it might have been better to use tomato sauce instead of paste.

"i served this last week for our dinner after heading out to the mountains to get our christmas tree! i made it a few days prior to allow the flavours to develop.  it was the best lamb curry ever! and so raved the man - he even said it was the very best lamb curry he's ever had! and we grew up eating curries so!!<br/><br/>i followed the recipe pretty much except 1) i used one 14oz can chopped tomatoes 2) i used greek yogurt (as suggested by some reviews) and 3) i used about 1 1/2 c - 2 c water given the feedback here.<br/><br/>it turned out phenomenal, and on the day itself i heated it up in the oven and took the lid off for about 20 mins to let the sauce evaporate a little more.  i do agree that if you put in 4c as the recipe suggests, it's a lot of liquid (like soup almost).  and finally, i wouldn't use greek yogurt again, i think if you eyeball the water, normal yogurt will do.  the greek yogurt did not thicken things up and i think normal yogurt would have a more impact on the flavour.  enjoy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal fabchefs reply 9 i used coconut milk instead of yogurt, excellent icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mikiones reply 6 i made this last saturday and followed it pretty closely.  i used only 3 serrano peppers, as the ones i had were very large.  i did add two tsp of cayenne red pepper to spice it up a bit more.  i also added 2 tsp curry powder instead of 1 and added 1 tsp of fenugreek powder (methi), as i like that taste.  i cooked the lamb slowly, simmering it for about 2 hours with all of the spices added.   i used plain yogurt and not the greek yogurt that others suggested.  the sauce came out perfectly, just the right consistency and flavor.  all 6 of us loved the taste and texture of this curry.  i served it with basmati rice and nan bread.  for an appetizer, we had lentil filled samosa's (bought frozen from an indian grocery and a mint/cucumber/yogurt sauce, which i made up without a recipe.   this curry is definitely one that i will make again and will not adjust the recipe at all. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal anonymous reply 5 i made this for dinner last night and it was good but it's a lot better today. i used less water (2-2 1/2 cups), more yogurt, and blended with an immersion blender at the end (keep the blade close to bottom of pot to avoid meat chunks) to get a thicker sauce. the sauce is also good over meatballs. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lyn2946 reply 4 see 1 reply this was really good, my family really enjoyed this. i have tried many tomato based indian lamb curries, but i have never found anything i really liked. this recipe tasted like the lamb curry my old neighbors from pakistan used to make, i am going to keep making this recipe and will stop looking for another one. i think the difference for me in this recipe compared to others, are the peppercorns (they add a really lovely flavor, that matches well with the cinnamon and the brown cardamom). i made a few small changes. i only used 2 tablespoons of oil (for dietary reasons), and i think this recipe would be good with this amount of oil or with more (you could probably get away with one tablespoon as well). i forgot to add the yogurt at the end, but i think i liked it better that way (i will try it with yogurt and with coconut milk some other times as well). the only other thing i changed was to use only one clove because i think too many cloves make food taste bitter. i simmered the lamb for one and a half hours on a low heat, (lamb needs a long cooking time to become tender). if i were to add yogurt another time i would simmer just in tomato and water until the lamb was tender and just near the end add the yogurt (and any excess water can be boiled down on high heat before adding the yogurt, so the amount of water should not be a problem). in the future i will try adding lentils and will also try adding potatoes, i think these additions would suit this curry well. thank you so much for a great recipe that will be on my regular rotation. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zainab23 reply 4"

"thankyou for posting this delicious recipe. i sprinkled some chaat masala and roasted, ground cumin seeds on top along with some sliced jalapeno. i loved the sweet and sour and salty combination that instantly tickle the taste buds. thanks again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal queenchef reply 1 i also used red onion instead of shallot. i make my own tamarind syrup so i used that instead of paste. since the tamarind syrup is made with sugar, i just omitted that and it was fine. the lime squeezed on top really made the flavors pop. you called this a 'snack'. we had it for dinner and found it quite filling by itself. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal charlie a. reply i used minced red onion as i did not have a shallot. love the tamarind! i use the dark kind in the plastic jar. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tamarinda reply i tried this recipe last week and was part way through before i realised that the shallots weren't supposed to be cooked.  i thought that was unusual, so i sauteed them a little bit first.  the tamarind paste i had was the dark variety that looks like molasses and comes in a plastic container, so the dish did not look pretty and the tamarind totally masked the delicate flavour of the shallots.  i think it would be better made with the other, purple variety of tamarind that comes in a glass jar.  overall the dish was nice and tangy, and was quick to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jo_c. reply"

"my first rating to food.com/recipezaar although i've been using the site for years. this is fabulous! easy and delicious. a top-notch recipe that i'll be making again and again. thanks!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal judybat reply 1 i love indian food.  this was easy and delicious! thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sbera007 reply 1 this was very good.  my variations from your recipe: cut the chicken into 1/2"" cubes & add 1 to 1.5 tsp. salt.  it was a perfect amount of spicy but not hot sauce & the chicken ended up very tender  .  everything on the ingredient list is pretty much a staple in my house so that's always nice.  provided the husband likes it i'll be adding this to the rotation. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal coraniaid reply this was very good - chicken korma is my husband's favorite indian food and he really liked it. i cut the chicken stock to 125 ml as previous posters suggested, but forgot to reduce the yogurt.  also, i only had ground coriander power, but it was still really good.  there was a lot of sauce, but we liked it that way.  thanks for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rookie_cook reply this was pretty good.  the yoghurt was a little overpowering and it thinned the sauce out a little too much so i had to add a bit more flour. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal iatemygluestick reply"
"this recipe had such good reviews that i thought to try it since i had loads of carrots in my fridge.  so delicious!!! i used less butter than the recipe and added a bit of cinnamon at the end.  it has to be the best carrot halwa i have ever had! in fact i am making it right now for a potluck with my friends.  thanks for posting this awesome dessert!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal eboneham reply 2 i've never tried a recipe like this before and so i was happy to make it. it was delicious! it really brought out the natural sweetness of the carrots. perfect with the chopped pistachios at the end. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 this is almost like the dessert served in my local indian restaurant.  very easy to make.  i substituted evaporated milk for the half-and-half.   it took less time for me than the recipe indicates -- only 30 minutes to absorb the evaporated milk, then only another 10 minutes until it was ready to serve.  yum! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ohyoucook reply 1 made this with dinner tonight and it was yummy! i didn't realize i didn't have the raisins until i needed them, so i had to leave them out. i will definitely be making this again, and won't forget to get the raisins! also, i used fat free half and half and it was great. thanks for a wonderful indian dessert! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal suztheq reply 1 this doesn't seem to yield a whole lot, but i absolutely love it! thank you so much for the recipe! i will make it again and again, although for all of the work that it takes with the stirring, i think that i will double the recipe next time. i want it to last for a couple of days, because it's so delicious! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal claudine h. reply"
"this was the best ladoooooooooo i have ever eaten.soooooooooooooooooooo gooooooood and yummyyyyy. thankyou charishma. you are the best.....if you guys haven't tried it please try it, you won't be sorry.... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nd2791 reply 1 i tried this recipe today.  the amount of ghee listed as 1/2 cup to 2 cups gram flour did not come close to being able to form balls.  i added another 1/4 cup.  my husband's reaction was ""did you add coarse salt to this because i am biting into grits.?"" no, of course not, it was the granuated sugar.  i agree with heather's review that if anyone tries this recipe to use powered sugar.  i cannot say i will try this again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal linda h. reply this is the same as my recipe only i use 1 cup of powdered sugar to be sure there are no gritty granules. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal heatherdawn._ reply i halved this recipe and make 11 small laddoos. it was excellent and just as i remember it. thanks, charishma! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dimpi reply this came out so well and i was very surprised because i am a novice in making any kind of sweets leave alone ladoos. we do not have much of a sweet tooth in the family, so we do not really make many except for the occasional kheer on festival days. i tried this because it seemed so easy. and it was, the proportions were all perfect and so was the method. i halved the recipe and it made 5 ladoos. i think the trick is how to catch the ladoos, to make the balls while it is hot. and mine came out in all shapes except round :( very sadly but then this is the first time. i guess one does need experience to do it and also you should be able to stand the heat on your hands while making the ladoos. is there any particular method or trick to it, i don't know. hopefully, i will have better shaped ladoos next time. thanks for the recipe, char. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sangeetha reply"
"one of my favorite indian desserts, love the rich cardamom flavor. never thought to add bananas before, fantastic!! zwt6 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal thymestudio reply 1 we all really enjoyed this different (for us) rice pudding.  the cardamom really came through and the saffron added both flavour and colour.  thanks for a great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal evelynathens reply 1 this was a wonderful creamy kheerni, i liked the banana twist.  will be adding this to my favourites.  i made this for unrated asian recipe tag game july-aug 2009 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal coasty reply 1"
"outstanding recipe, easy to make and better than any restaurant version i've had ... for those using the nutritional analysis, it is incorrect -- the software assumes that the entire 1 quart of vegetable oil is consumed in this recipe, hence the outrageous figures (2034 calories, 218 g fat per serving, etc.). in fact, the amount of oil used/consumed is more like 3 tbsp, so the per serving figures should be about 100 calories/serving and 4 g total fat. tastes great and you can feel good about eating it!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gandalf the white reply 1 easy to prepare and very good.   i did think the vinegar taste a little strong,  but my husband loved them.   actually, i loved them, very more-ish, and will definitely make them again, just saying, you can taste the vinegar :)    thank you, much enjoyed, made for pac spring 2013 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen elizabeth reply this was the first time i had ever made bhajis and these were wonderful!  even better than what we've had in restaurants. the vinegar and spices make a wonderful combination. i will be making these again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lauriejoyce reply"
i've never heard of/or have made this recipe before and so it was nice to try something new. i'm so glad i gave it a try because it was i normally wouldn't have made it before. i highly recommend it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1
