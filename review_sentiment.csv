i am so thrilled with the taste of this biscotti,5.22,6.66,Italian
 i got into a baking frenzy last year during christmas and decided to try for the first time ever making biscotti,5.162109468604117,6.446435257231871,Italian
 i used this recipe and i was so happy with it,4.980032034169781,6.432181197953247,Italian
 <br/><br/>i was reading other reviews and a few things i think might help people who have problems with sticky dough:<br/><br/>watch the humidity and warmth in your working space,4.861058198103131,5.696126847165518,Italian
 a few times i cooked this recipe while i was cooking something else or washing dishes (once with the dish washer and once by hand),4.747569987301005,6.197926214585321,Italian
 the dough turned out sticky and i had wondered what i did wrong since i did everything exactly the same and all the other times i made the dough it was perfect,5.062363076700908,5.597960493219672,Italian
 after a few times of going through this i figured out that even the slightest temperature and humidity difference in the room had an effect,4.4030442023123815,5.6752972528538965,Italian
 i kept aware of this and i haven't had a single batch of sticky dough since,5.3291642392389615,5.684361552024178,Italian
"<br/><br/>if the dough turns out sticky for you, the first thing to do is chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or so to make it workable",5.330512296925738,5.683039087643776,Italian
" any time you're working with it and it starts getting sticky again, just put back in the refridgerator and chill it",5.279799990048936,5.3029618274149275,Italian
" after that, try opening a window and turning on a fan to cool and dry out your space and see if that helps",4.295055721486744,5.976370743907987,Italian
 you can add more flour to the recipe as some folks did (which will cut down the taste a little and make your cookies more crunchy) but it shouldn't be necessary,4.003836452744867,6.151075458437662,Italian
 first just try chilling the dough and cooling down and airing out/drying out your working space to see if it has an effect,5.0424972060554065,6.39958515413239,Italian

" i did not have a 3/4 cup of unblanched almonds, and decided to make up the shortfall with pistachios, which worked just fine",3.8782169062816925,6.028686214666704,Italian

 i'd like to add the warning that this recipe is perhaps not for novice bakers,4.746586949844947,6.095114063874163,Italian

" do not use an ordinary carving or paring knife, no matter how sharp",4.26,5.64,Italian

") to be the right heat, and for the final baking i turned my oven to 160 deg c, which is 325 deg f",3.982754920217377,6.154287105297494,Italian

  the only thing i changed was using spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce (the can i thought i had was no where to be found) and used 1/2 the amout of mozzarella cheese,3.975392876574932,6.1532848855472455,Italian

"

the batch i froze was made into 6 patties, also with 1/2 the cheese",4.012875536480687,6.2236231884057975,Italian
  i browned the patties and placed in a foil pan,4.612751091703057,5.469,Italian

  i covered the pan with foil and slid (with directions for baking) into a large ziploc bag,4.678029978586725,5.723459459459459,Italian
  last night i pulled it out of the freezer until time to cook,4.25258484156563,6.219137020296557,Italian
  it probably could have used a few extra minutes in the oven and next time i'll cook the meat patties longer until closer to done,4.0120595328355115,5.828087401379098,Italian
  the flavor was much better after freezing (maybe from the sauce being in contact longer) but i'll still add a sprinkle of garlic or onion powder and italian seasoning next time as we like a stronger flavor,4.249498664622627,6.244411607083446,Italian

 suggest you stir in the yogurt before you return the meat to the pan (easier to blend and stir) and if you prepare this in a dutch oven (pot you can use on the stove and in the oven) when its all ready to simmer you can just pop it in a low oven for a couple of hours and walk away and do other things,4.256983531560555,5.833866965747826,Indian

"2 1/2 cups), more yogurt, and blended with an immersion blender at the end (keep the blade close to bottom of pot to avoid meat chunks) to get a thicker sauce",4.072482500581266,5.177330211612962,Indian

" i forgot to add the yogurt at the end, but i think i liked it better that way (i will try it with yogurt and with coconut milk some other times as well)",4.496586170867567,6.4278227255439955,Indian
 the only other thing i changed was to use only one clove because i think too many cloves make food taste bitter,4.272228633575651,6.165845097342283,Indian
" i simmered the lamb for one and a half hours on a low heat, (lamb needs a long cooking time to become tender)",3.527007426762537,5.573767518117967,Indian
" if i were to add yogurt another time i would simmer just in tomato and water until the lamb was tender and just near the end add the yogurt (and any excess water can be boiled down on high heat before adding the yogurt, so the amount of water should not be a problem)",4.310277967900444,6.1601235405318295,Indian

  /  /  peachie keene  i was frightened by romi's suggestion to leave rice on the counter for up to 2 days,4.064284302657938,4.546459659012549,Thai
  please read the following and consider before following her advice,3.9295441244497353,6.037597136759071,Thai
"

according to 'food standards agency' ",3.83,5.38,Thai
" uncooked rice can contain spores of bacillus cereus, bacteria that can cause food poisoning",4.815744803418344,5.322219618537424,Thai
" when the rice is cooked, the spores can survive",3.7257423580786035,6.639969325153375,Thai
" then, if the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores will germinate into bacteria",3.662365561185946,5.111841913970147,Thai
 these bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins (poisons) that cause vomiting or diarrhoea,3.7085460607466243,5.300051906666667,Thai
 reheating the rice won't get rid of these toxins,3.98676923076923,5.034611111111111,Thai
"

so, the longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that bacteria, or the toxins they produce, could stop the rice being safe to eat",4.404469070113865,5.928134169327424,Thai
"

it's best to serve rice when it has just been cooked",4.794174750213843,6.343860026623387,Thai
" if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) and keep it in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating",3.877656176333178,6.434948761449749,Thai

 i often take fresh kaffir lime leaves and chop them finely and add them either instead of or in addition to the cilantro,4.108025976913275,5.926879516623951,Thai

 the purple coloring is the natural color of black rice's husks which are not removed,5.117057982121524,5.771216202962771,Thai

" being cream, i think it will melt a bit if warmed, so that will be one tweak is to steal all the cream and enough milk to make one cup and warm it and stir it smooth before putting it in so it swirls in a bit",4.03732461996015,5.572913534848345,Thai

i don't care how many rapturous reviews you have for this recipe: the broth tastes terrible cooked this way,4.508289884856859,5.564039731977288,French
 there are many recipes for mussels on the internet and they all agree that you should saute the shallots and garlic in butter (or olive oil) before adding the white wine etc,3.9082401823981616,6.235505959065747,French
 otherwise you are simply boiling them and they turn out bitter,4.73369768586903,5.046347580397676,French

 the instructions for the substitutions are very helpful,4.82488,6.4518402777777775,Japanese
 i suggest not adding the apple because it doesn't really make a world of difference,4.753581496740891,6.051959162819442,Japanese
 i actually prefer mine without it,4.24,6.26,Japanese
 i added a few more tablespoons of curry powder just because i like the spice,4.153012048192771,6.6588884999124796,Japanese
 do not add more water into this recipe unless the curry is starting to stick to the bottom as you're cooking,4.067081914306897,6.08987605070174,Japanese
" the best way to make a thick sauce is to use the chicken stock as specified in the instructions, while cooking with the lid closed",4.1635384503093285,6.170021989211517,Japanese
" if needed, then add water to prevent from sticking<br/><br/>***important tip: after making the roux (after adding curry powder/tomatoes) i suggest using a shifter to dissolve the mix into the chicken stock",4.568866141954462,5.895833692523996,Japanese
 i find that this is the easiest way to thoroughly dissolve the roux,4.484756028768862,5.785930985540672,Japanese

" here's a few tips: 1) for first timer, to beat egg white to become foamy and peak, you must make sure the bowl and beater does not have oil",4.050145222487367,5.5825779540460045,Japanese
 must be absolutely clean,4.152735723771581,6.481941941941942,Japanese
 don't use plastic bowl because oil tends to stay on it even after cleaning,3.4198729277776794,5.670081263803943,Japanese
 egg white must not have even a slight egg yolk in it,3.7350828519718657,6.043430470932228,Japanese
" normally people beat egg yolk first, but i am lazy",4.405655946699065,5.383086919654629,Japanese
" i beat the white first, so i don't need to clean the beater when i use for egg yolk",4.240686641406196,5.39179809869834,Japanese
 but you have to make sure you prepare all the ingredients and work fast,4.030313907626887,6.040141943240947,Japanese
 otherwise the foamy egg white will become flat,3.50423581999172,5.918102092147953,Japanese
 2)you might need to consider reducing lemon juice or go with none,4.4472013936826675,5.876867547860321,Japanese

"5 hours, using a square pan",3.800437852269356,5.131838565022422,Japanese
 4) cool it in the oven that you turn off so it doesn't sink,3.403431097692474,6.002306050320188,Japanese

  as you cook the chicken this fat becomes liquid (a liquid which will not reduce no matter how long you continue to simmer you sauce)  you may want to try grilling or other wise cooking the meat prior to adding it to the glaze,4.438173751995657,5.677554093456967,Japanese
  you can then drain off the resulting fat,3.4989135645320735,4.315565058454323,Japanese
  this should enable you to thicken your glaze with greater ease and it will also reduce the saturated fat that the meal contains,4.3180188422758325,5.660910123297316,Japanese
"  additionally, if you have the time you can put the sauce in the oven at 375 for half an hour to 45 min prior to starting your dinner",4.040319310909936,6.121226161621131,Japanese
