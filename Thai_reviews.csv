"absolutely wonderful flavor.  highly recommended.  don't be affraid of the hot chili, the coconut milk neutrolizes the hot.  the soup actually has a sweet flavor.  the broth is thinner than you'd expect, but it doesn't distract from the recipe at all.  i found the time estimates a little short, give yourself a little extra time.  i found fresh galangal root and lime leaves impossible to find on short notice.  the local asian market doesn't stock them.  you really need a thai or vietnamise grocer.  the asian grocer recommended substituting ginger root for the galangal root, and lemon peels for the lime leaves.  both of these worked out fine, you just have to separate them out before serving. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teaganm reply 16 incredible flavor, easy and quick but tastes like an all day affair. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal fiona robison reply 11 there seems to be a lot of coconut milk for such a small quanitity of stock.  i also think there is too much chicken in this recipe and will use less than 1 lb.  it is only 3 cups so the ratio of 1 1/4 lbs of chicken to 3 cups of soup just doesnt jive icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal susan fulchiero reply 7 see 1 reply very good job cameron!<br/>i am from the us and i have lived in thailand for the past 9 years.<br/>the only comments i would make to your recipe, are:<br/>i always boil the kafir lime leaf, lemon grass, and galangal root first, for at least 1/2 hr. or until the aroma fills the air.<br/>i use leg and thigh meat because it's more tender and moist.<br/>ingredients that you list that i don't use are, ginger, cilantro, and sugar.<br/>one more point to all of the viewers, is: coconut milk and lime juice are the very last thing when the soup is finished. they will both lose there flavor if cooked any length of time.<br/>everything else is perfect! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal glen h. reply 5 see 1 reply my husband doesn't care much for chicken, and he just loves this recipe! i highly reccomend it since it is very tasty, and easy to make! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal darcie kelly reply 5"
"kao pad really needs fish sauce. without it, it is not thai fried rice. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gary c. reply 2 i can't get enough of this recipe. this is going to be my new go-to fried rice recipe. i made it as stated, but next time i might add shrimp or pork to it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 very yummy, very easy dinner! i've made it a few times now and when i need a meal fast i'll use frozen stir fry mix. it's just as delicious without tomato.i increased the sriracha 'cos i love spicy food and have triedwhat one reviewer suggested and topped it with peanuts. recommended! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal honeychile reply 1 delicious!  i made 1/2 the recipe and had more than enough for the 2 of us.  to make a full meal, i marinated chicken breast chunks in soy sauce and stir-fried it before adding the veggies. i used 2 of the little chili sauce packets from our favorite take-out restaurant and that was the perfect heat for me. it seemed to be lacking in salt so i added quite a bit more soy sauce. spice-head dh added more chili sauce to his.  while maybe not authentic, i topped it off with minced cilantro and a few peanuts for crunch. thanks for sharing this easy and tasty recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal susiequsie reply 1 loved it! thanks! very pretty and pretty tasty! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal malevy reply"
"i love larb and this is an excellent recipe for it. i'm always trying new versions and fiddling around getting the best proportions, but i followed this pretty much to the letter.  didn't have onions so left them out but made up for it with the whites of the green onions.  the toasted and ground rice is essential.   thanks, sue. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jangomango reply 1 i put 3 because i haven't tried yet... but i see no directions for the lemongrass: ""1 stalk""???? that's it? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michael l. reply see 1 reply this is my standard ""go-to"" in thai restaurants, and i make my own version at home.  this is absolutely delicious!  the fish sauce, lemongrass and roasted rice powder are essential to give it the right flavor balance.  i add a little thai basil or cilantro at times and i serve it with cabbage instead of lettuce.  i eat it hot and cold and use steamed white rice when there is extra juice, because i am just weird like that--i am a larb addict...thanks for the wonderful recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ssinderella reply love it!!! i didn't know this was so easy to make. i love the lemon and cilantro combination so i added more of both. i used a coffee grinder to grind the toasted rice. this is a keeper! thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chocho reply easy to do and very good! used ground pork instead, but everything else the same. made for zwt4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal charmie777 reply"
"was fun to make my own curry and it was very good! 5 stars for the homemade curry paste. i served this over udon noodles. be sure to buy peeled and deveined shrimp. i didn't think about it and it was a process to peel and devein 2 and a half pounds of shrimp! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal victoria v. reply 2 my husband gave this recipe ""12 stars"" last night (out of 10), and i have to agree it is excellent- i would say restaurant quality. i used green beans from the garden and cooked them until tender (8 minutes). i only  used 1 lb of shrimp and it was a decent amount, and also omitted the jalapenos to lessen the heat. decided to splurge and use full fat coconut milk (instead of light) and it was the right decision. so delicious, especially with the squeeze of fresh lime over the finished dish, the flavors really popped! served over jasmine rice. thanks a bunch, dr. jenny. [made for zaar chef alphabet soup] icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal averybird reply 2 we all enjoyed this curry very much. we did not have problems for the preparation and we liked the beans too. thanks for posting this recipe!<br/>like in asia (especially in thailand), vegetables are never overcooked  preserving their vitamins very well. some people said that green beens need a longer cooking time (about 15 minutes).  i also consider that cooking is a form of injury to the plant, but maybe the heat deactivates the cyanide that is then released. not all kind of green beans have the same content of the toxic substance (phasin).<br/>done dfor zwt7. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal artandkitchen reply 2 this was terrific!  i halved the recipe and used less than 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno (wimpy!) and it still had just the right amount of a noticeable kick. i used my hand-held immersion blender to chop up all of the indicated ingredients. will be making this again, soon. thanks, dr. jenny! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal linky reply 1 very much enjoyed, thank you.   since i had a surfeit of broccoli and no green beans, i used the broccoli, hope you dont mind, it was very good!  served with steamed white rice for a really good dinner, definitely a keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen elizabeth reply 1"
"this is absolutely delicious! substituted chilies for cored/deseeded jalapeños, bulked up a little more on the vegetables. so, so yummy. give it a try! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tracy carlin reply 2 it was really good. i used 2 thai bird chilies and that was nice mild heat. recipe didn’t say when to add bell peppers so i added it at the same time as onions. i also used ground beef cause i had some available. i would use a little less fish sauce and maybe add a squeeze of lime juice next time. really good as lettuce wrap filling. it was a quick recipe. great for weeknight meal. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal wcfoodee reply 1 this was a snap and absolutely delicious--i had some tenderloin flap meat i'd trimmed off a whole tenderloin and used it..this recipe will be a staple--quick, delicious and easy. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal crfdc reply 1 great recipe ! also good with chicken instead of beef :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal steph_wood6 reply 1 lawd this was good!  i loooove thai foods so i've finally given up and decided to move to thailand, i'm not kidding.  on my honor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gailanng reply 1"
"i must say that this is a wonderful recipe. 

when i made this the first time i had a taste of the dressing just to make sure and i thought i was headed for a disaster given its weird taste, a sourish and saltish flavor. 

but when i started tossing the greens together the aroma of the different spices was heavenly!

when i combined the greens and the dressing, the taste was wonderful! i was so wrong about the taste! 

i've replaced beef with roast chicken and it tastes just as great. 

i made this for a party and separated it into three parts since i have vegetarian friends coming over and they loved it! it makes a great vegetarian salad. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chap heng reply 25 this recipe is fabulous! i didn't have any red chilies so i used one deseeded jalepeno and followed the recipe exactly other than that. my husband even loved it and he's super picky! thanks for a great summer salad i'll use over and over again!<br/>by the way, whole foods carries the lime leaves icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teachermisslisa reply 2 my o my, this was a very good dish!  i too was unsure about the dressing, the aroma of the fish sauce alarmed me.  but, once everything is pulled together and you take a bite, wow, your taste buds are assaulted with sweet, sour, salty, spicy..all at once.  it's wonderful!

i used a bag of ""spring mix"" greens from the grocery store here in the chicago area, and followed the recipe as kitchenmaniac writes it.  great recipe km, thanks a lot for another great recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hey jude reply 2 this salad is called num tok on thai menus. it means ?waterfall? and can also describe a meat soup, but most typically refers to the meat salad. the salad is also enjoyed by the lao people.

i will be making this tonight. i?m glad i ran across this recipe because i was trying to figure out what to do with this sirloin tip steak i?ve had in the freezer. i can?t believe this wasn?t the first thing i thought of, i?ve been making num tok for at least 6 years now.

this is a great basic recipe although i offer these few suggestions to folks who are trying this for the first time.

1-unless you are fond of bland food (i mean no offence,  a lot of people eat bland food because they can?t handle powerful flavors and spices and the salt paranoia of late has people making tragically unsalted dishes) i recommend seasoning the meat. at least salt and pepper, and if you are grilling, don?t oil the meat, oil the grill grate. (just my opinion, oil lets too much of the spice fall off when grilling. kitchenmaniac has no seasoning in this recipe, so if you go that route, oiling the meat is just fine.)

a nice perforating of the meat with a fork or better yet a culinary needler, also called a tenderizer and a few hours in a marinade that is similar or just like the sauce in this recipe will amp this recipe up nicely.

2-the kaffir and mint leaves are a bit out of the usual. no problem using them but i can?t stand kaffir lime leaf for some reason except a little bit in a red curry paste and a touch in a tom yum goong soup.

this mint in this recipe would be replaced with thai basil more traditionally in my experience. use the mint for mojitos!

3-grilling the chilies a little bit will alter their flavor in a good way. do this ahead of time and pop them in the fridge to make them cool.

if you really like thai level heat, mince one or two (depending on the punishment you deserve) thai hot peppers in to the dressing (also often called bird?s eye chilies). they are nuclear like habaneros but like habaneros are to mexican food they have a distinct flavor only a thai hot can give.

almost any variety of vegetable would be good with this salad. broccoli and cauliflower would be a bit weird i think but i would use tomato, cucumber, julienned or shredded carrot, shredded or finely cut cabbage or baby bok choy?even fresh squash like yellow or zucchini thinly cut or julienned if i had on hand. may be a step out of traditional, but delicious.

4-the dressing is straight up the mother?s milk of thai style sauces and can be used for dipping thai summer rolls in, instead of or along with the typical peanut sauce typically served with summer rolls, but add a little water for use as a dip to soften it a bit.

also, i tend to not use as much sugar. thai restaurants sweeten dishes for the america palette just like chinese places do. they don?t really eat everything so sweet and they do not sprinkle peanuts over everything. play around with the balance of ingredients for the sauce and you?ll get it just right for you. you may like sweet, but not me?not for dinner at least. this recipe is pretty much straight down the line what you will read all over and is tried and true though.

props to kitchenmaniac for not sprinkling peanuts all over this salad. peanuts, contrary to a lot of people?s thinking does not make dishes ?thai?. there are a few thai dishes peanuts are called for?a few. this is not one of them.

5-finally, it is traditional to sprinkle a little ground roasted rice on this salad. roast uncooked rice in a pan or toaster oven just until they begin to turn yellowish/light brown then finely grind in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. make a batch and it keeps for a very long time on the spice shelf/rack. the texture this adds is something you?ll be sorry you have missed all this time?for most people at least?your mileage may vary.

i love num tok! if you can?t tell by now. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kennifira malcom sh reply 1 see 1 reply excellent!  i made extra batch of the dressing and let the cooked meat (i used flank steak) marinate in it for a few hours.  i didn't use very many of the red peppers, only used one.  also, i tossed the salad with sesame oil first so the dressing would have something to stick to.  there was chili pepper flakes on the side so people could add heat if they liked. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal leannestock reply 1"
"thank you!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal starcry reply amazing! i discovered this recipe back in 2012 and i’ve been making it ever since. as written, it’s a wonderful recipe that’s flavorful and easy. i always believe that a recipe should be reviewed as is before tweaking it. so that being said, here are all the changes i made after trying this already great recipe (to my preferences) added in an extra tbsp of the curry and sambal. after sautéing it i added garlic, onion, ginger, snow peas, and shiitake mushrooms. used light coconut milk (makes it less rich) less fish sauce, and add sriracha. and along with the lime and peanuts i topped with green onions and cilantro! this recipe is even great with tofu. i’m making again with chicken thighs tomorrow. thanks so much for the great recipe! it’s warm, spicy and creamy, and super easy to make! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal neesa r. reply this is by far my favorite recipe!!!!! thank you! we've made it multiple times and love it!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal francesca f. reply wow, by far the best curry recipe i've found. because i like the heat i added another tbl of curry & an extra tsp of sambal. could had added more but the wife wouldn't appreciate that. i also used 2/3 cup of peanut butter in all & topped with cilantro, green onion & peanuts.
thanks for a great recipe!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal thunt618 reply excellent - dh and i are on a health kick and this was very easy to lighten up. we used lite coconut milk, cut the oil for sauteing chicken in half. with these two adjustments it cuts the calories almost in half. this is so very good. thanks heidisue icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal penny_7557206 reply"
"this pad thai was great!  i recomend doubling the sauce (fish sauce, vin, black pepper, brown sugar., ect?)  i also add red pepper flakes for heat.

i didnt boil the rice noodles.  what i did do is get the pot of water boiling then turned the heat down to mid low while adding the pasta.  then i stired it a few times and 10-14mins later they were done in time to be added to dish.

oh and before i forget. add just a lil less vinager than it calls for.

thanks again for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rand0mh3r0 reply 5 i have made this for myself for a while and enjoyed a lot... and then i made it for my boyfriend. he asks for it once a week now, and adores the leftovers. thanks for the recipe! i double the sauce ingredients, increase the chicken to four breasts, and use snow peas instead of beansprouts, but the rest is perfect! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal joani bond reply 2 i just wanted to add some tips for this.i have made pad thai many times & took cooking classes in thailand.this sauce is really a ""drunken noodle"" without basil.if you soak the noodles in warm water for 20 minutes they come out great;no cooking,this is how i was taught.tamarind juice is the real ingredient used and thai soy sauce that has more of a boullion/caramel taste to it than regular soy.i am not trying to to be petty,just trying to enlighten.also blanch your mungs sprouts first,much better that way.there are so many americanized versions of pad thai but the authentic ones have very simple ingredients. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal somogirl reply 2 it is a great receipe. i believe when stir the bean sprouts quickly is also important because the longer the cooking time, the more water comes out and make the noodle more sticky. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stella yuen reply 2 i doubled the sauce ingredients like others suggested and the dish turned out amazing. i like to drench my pad thai with lots of lime juice as well. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ivansocal reply 1"
"i followed the recipe almost exactly. i always do so i can fairly rate a recipe. the ingredients i did not change, i marinaded for almost 12 hours. the only thing i did different was just dumped the chicken and marinade in a pan and fried it, then served it all over a bed of chinese noodles i found in the asian section of my grocery store. it was marvelous ! this recipe is a keeper, thank you for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mwils33 reply 4 this recipe was absolutely delicious. restaurant quality, and simple to make. i had never made kebabs and it was easy. marinated about 3 hours and it was plenty. due to lack of grill, i broiled. worked great. one warning: do not spill this on a light-colored sweater. yikes. but the dinner was worth it.. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cooking in ct reply 1 see 1 reply excellent, very authentic tasting. we grilled the chicken, but i didn't have time to baste it or marinade it very long. so instead, i mixed the coconut milk in with the marinade. it was still excellent, even with the changes in implementation. a new favorite. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kim reply 1 i made this for my very fussy family and they all loved it! it was so easy to make and is a new weekly favourite. it is a delicious recipe. thanks rita! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal learner of world cu reply 1 i marinated by chicken strips for almost 24 hours then cooked on a george foreman grill. very good!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen in tbay reply 1"
"i was looking for a recipe similar to the thai chicken pasta dish at cheesecake factory, and this was very close. to bring it closer to the cheesecake factory dish, i added two cut up chicken breasts, which i cooked until it turned white before adding the carrots and vegetables. also, i increased the peanut butter by a tablespoon, doubled the chili sauce, and topped the final dish with fresh bean sprouts. one more thing; whisk the sauce ingredients before adding it to the vegetables to make a smooth sauce. my whole family loved this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michellebelle61 reply 12 thank you so much for this recipe! i have made it quite a few times since finding it. last time i cut up chicken breasts and cooked them first with garlic, and then added them to the veggies and sauce while the sauce was thickening. very good! *i don't use sesame oil and i cut up fresh broccoli and carrots icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jusme reply 4 i hate being that guy that changes up recipes and reviews them (giving it a 5 star anyway) changes i made: -thick rice noodles instead of linguine noodles -2 cups fresh veg (broccoli and red pepper) instead of frozen veg -added whisked egg while it was being stir fried together -garnish with peanuts, cilantro and a lime wedge for spritzing after that, very authentic and amazing. cheers icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jon b. reply 3 see 2 replies yum, yum, yum!! i was craving thai noodles and this hit the spot dead on. i cut the sesame oil down to a little over 2 tablespoons and used shredded cabbage instead of frozen veggies. once plated, i squeeezed a little fresh lime juice on top. thanks for posting. i'll be making this again and again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lucky in bayview reply 2 very good! i added chicken with the garlic and ginger. instead of using the frozen stir fry veggies, i used fresh broccoli, which i added once the chicken was cooked. for the chili-garlic sauce, i used sriracha hot chili sauce. the dh called it awesome. :) thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adventurousbeginner reply 2"
"wonderful!  this exactly the same tea i have been served in thai recipes and have tried to duplicate for some time.  really delicious and unique.  the color is gorgeous - the orangey color of the tea topped with the creamy half n half makes a striking presentation in a clear glass.  note:  only thai tea leaves will produce the unique color and taste.  i found mine in an asian market in a giant bag, but have also seen them for sale in online asian markets. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal heatherfeather reply 8 see 1 reply very good.  i would recommend making twice the default amount listed here (6 servings), as it'll be consumed very quickly.  i had great results with substituting sweetened condensed milk, ~2.5 tbs. per serving, and reducing the sugar to ~5 tbs. for six servings.

according to 'food standards agency' -- uncooked rice can contain spores of bacillus cereus, bacteria that can cause food poisoning. when the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. then, if the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores will germinate into bacteria. these bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins (poisons) that cause vomiting or diarrhoea. reheating the rice won't get rid of these toxins.

so, the longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that bacteria, or the toxins they produce, could stop the rice being safe to eat.

it's best to serve rice when it has just been cooked. if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) and keep it in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jenny ann reply"

"i'm afraid i'd have to resort to profanity to describe how much i enjoyed this dish. fabulous! it was very easy to prepare. the only thing i did different was cooking about 5 minutes extra after adding the chili, broccoli, and onion (that is just a personal thing as i like broccoli very tender when cooked), and also doubling the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and brown sugar. other than that i followed the directions to the letter and it came out absolutely fabulous. thank you very much, i will be making this again and it will most likely be a larger batch. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kevin young reply 4 see 1 reply this was really delicious. i doubles sauce, added a little fish sauce (1 tbsp), and substituted dried red pepper for the chiles. i know that's not authentic but it's all i had on hand, and it is delicious. the key to this is the basil, get thai basil, and real chiles would make this even better. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sloopgregb reply 2 this was my first time making drunken noodles at home, and they were really easy to make and so delicious! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal esteban reply 1 this is a great recipe!!!!! i am addicted to drunken noodles (as evidenced by my frequent take-out from a local thai eatery) and could easily eat it every night. i, too, doubled the sauce recipe. i used frozen shrimp and added it at the end of the recipe. thank you so very much. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal pat d. reply 1 very good recipe, but definitely double the sauce - otherwise it is just too dry. thai chili paste also works instead of fresh thai chilis if they are not readily available. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cortney christina reply 1"
"i paired these green beans with roasted shrimp and they were a hit! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal esteban reply 1 pretty good, but could have been just little better. if i make this recipe again, i'm omitting the lemon -- to me it tastes weird with peanut butter! on the preparation side, i recommend steaming the green beans tender-crisp before stir-frying them. also, to keep the tofu firm, you can cut it into 1/2"" slabs and wrap them in a dishtowel to absorb excess water, then dry them even more by cutting them into squares and baking them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal motleycook reply 1 not bad...  i'm the only one in the house who eats tofu that isn't hidden in a smoothie, so this made a ton for me.  i hope it freezes well.  i enjoyed the flavor of this, although i had a low carb satay sauce i had already made in the fridge and used that for the sauce.  i think next time i make this, i'll cut way back on the amount of peanuts, because for my tastes this had too much, and overpowered the flavors of everything else.  i'll probably go for about 3/4 cup peanuts max, but it was good enough that i'm willing to fiddle with it to get it to my tastes.  only change besides using my own satay was to add some carrots to the green beans while stir frying.  thanks for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal queen roachie reply just made this for dinner tonight.  we followed the directions except we used a wheat free tamari as we had a gluten free guest.  all of us loved it.  thanks for a great recipe icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vegan mom reply loved this! i haven't made the peanut sauce from this recipe as i usually make this when i'm feeling lazy and i love my bottled peanut sauce i have in the fridge. but the tofu is fantastic, it is also very good if you omit the green beans and put the tofu mixture on top of some baby spinach and brown rice. very very good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal meganjo reply"

"this recipe is fabulous.  i made it exactly as written.  served it over jasmine rice.
observations:  i would use thigh meat rather than breast, i would remove the ginger pieces or mince the ginger before adding.  i also gave fleeting thought to omitting the straw muchrooms - that would have been a mistake.
the end result was a little soupy, but i don't think i would change anything as the flavor balance would be off.  dogs lapped up the remaining juices anyway.
the curry is spicy if tasted separately.  i used the 4 tbl curry paste, but once over the rice it is fine.  i could even have it hotter. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mean chef reply 60 fabulous!  i could drink the sauce.i used chicken legs and thighs and tripled the recipe for happy hour event and served in chafing dish.  i browned the chicken in a little oil and added the rest of ingred./grated the ginger and used 1/2 sweetened coconut milk and 1/2 regular so left out the sugar. the mango was perfect addition. i'm learning i like everything the mean chef likes. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal linda in ventura reply 14 while this was a really good base for a curry dish, i felt like it needed some serious tweaks. there is way too much oil and way, way too much fish sauce; you could probably cut both ingredients in half and improve the flavor dramatically. otherwise it was quite tasty; the mangoes really rounded out the flavor a lot. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sass smith reply 5 another keeper at our house.  i subbed half the coconut milk with fat-free milk and coconut extract as suggested on this site and did not even notice.  next time i'll use all ff milk & extract to lower calorie/fat count.  i don't need to go to the thai restuarant anymore!  thanks dale! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karent reply 4 outstanding!!  if you like thai curries this will knock your socks off!!!  this is a restaurant grade recipe, for sure.  i was spoiled, eating thai curries from a wonderful chicago restaurant - hi ricky. i can now make it myself, with this recipe :-)  i used 1 1/2 lbs of bay scallops in lieu of chicken.  no need to remove the garlic.  the ginger mellows and softens after cooking, so it isn't so bad if you happen to bite a piece (i typically hate that, along with lemon grass!)  this was a superb meal and i seriously think its one of the best things i've ever made at home.  thanks so much for sharing this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ajaneck reply 4"

"this is a very delicious recipe.  i made some minor tweaks.. in addition to the cilantro salsa, i added a large handful of fresh cilantro as well as a little extra lime juice.  i also added a can of light coconut milk and a teaspoon or so of sriracha hot chili sauce for more heat.  i also used natural creamy peanut butter, which i would recommend over jiff or skippy.. the more natural peanut flavors complement the dish better than the added ingredients in other brands.  done in 6 hours on low in the crock pot.  the dish is more indian than thai - great over jasmine rice served with naan bread.  the best part?  the leftovers are even better.. all of the flavors mature and come together so nicely after a day or two in the fridge.  definitely a keeper!!

thank you so so much !!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal erica n. reply 3 admittedly, i have never enjoyed cooking...i'm sorta the anti-domestic diva...but as of late i have been attempting to do more meals at home...i still don't enjoy it like some folks, but i've impressed myself with my new found abilities.  i am a backslid vegetarian so i now eat chicken but not any other meat...just don't care for it to be honest...and i like spicy food, and i was looking for something quick and easy that could be thrown in my never-used crock pot...so i decided to try this.  i read thru the reviews to get pointers, etc, and decided that i definitely wanted to kick up the flavor a notch.  now, we just got thru eating my first/altered attempt at this recipe and i have to say that it was delicious!!!  and a lot cheaper than going to the thai restaurant.  my boyfriend loved it but i honestly don't think it would have been as good without my additions/changes.  i did use the basic recipe, however i doubled the amount of salsa.  i found some canned salsa in the mexican food section at wal-mart that said ""hot"" so that went into my cart.  i also used the low-sodium soy sauce, and bought jif extra crunchy peanut butter (the texture of the peanuts absolutely makes this dish for me).  i used about 32 ounces of salsa, about 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter, about 4-6 tablespoons of soy sauce (i just eyeballed it), i used about 2 teaspoons of fresh grated ginger (do not buy the powder stuff), i used a whole lime squeezed into the mixture, and i also added the following:  about a tablespoon (maybe a little more) of mccormick red curry powder, as well as about 2 tablespoons of ""thai kitchen--red curry paste""--both from wal-mart's spice section.  i also added about a 1/4 of a cup of ""house of tsang--bangkok peanut sauce"".  i will point out that i had started my chicken thighs in the crock pot about an hour before i added my ingredients because i had to run to the store to pick stuff up that i didn't have, but that didn't seem to hurt anything.  when i got back i did drain off a good bit of some of the icky juice from the thighs (as they weren't done) and then mixed all of my other ingredients in a bowl before i put them into the crock pot.  i also took the almost cooked chicken out of the crock pot, pulled the bones out, put all of the chicken back into the crock pot, and then after tasting my mixture of ingredients and feeling like it was the way i wanted it, i poured it over my chicken, stirred it, added about 10 dried chili peppers (this is key to getting some good spice taste), and turned it on high for another hour and a half to two hours.  all in all, the chicken cooked on its on about 2 hours on low, and then another hour and a half or so, with the mixture added, on high.  i did stir occassionally, and it was so good it was hard not to keep going back for more ""taste tests""...but finally i felt like it was done and it was super.  i also bought some jasmine rice at wal-mart, used about 2 cups of water and about 1 cup of coconut milk (the kind in the can is what i used), and let that come to a boil, and then subsequent simmer for about 40 minutes on top of the stove in a boiler (you can find various recipes on this site for the jasmine rice).  i also added about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger to my jasmine rice mixture as it cooked and, although it was the first time i have ever prepared jasmine rice, and therefore did not know what to expect, it turned out perfect.  it does have to cook on your lowest simmer setting for almost an hour (with a tight lid on it--try not to open too often) but when it is done the house smelled great and it was the perfect compliment to the main dish.  i do not think this would have been even remotely as good without my changes, but that's because my version ended up with just enough heat/spice and everyone else said that the original recipe was too mild.  this will definitely open your sinuses up but it's not too hot so don't be afraid to kick  it up a notch.  great dish...5 stars with my changes and can't wait to cook it again!

"oh wow, this was the best new recipe i've tried in a long time! like everything i cook, i had to modify the recipe slightly for what i had on hand and for personal tastes. for the chili oil i just substituted a tablespoon of sriracha. i used a handful of shredded carrots, a handful of shredded cabbage, and a small head of broccoli. finally, i substituted 5 tablespoons of powdered peanut butter in leiu of the real deal. this is cooking, not baking, so there's freedom to deviate from the original recipe. i'm making it again tonight and adding it to the weekly menu. it's my new favorite dish, for sure! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sunnysarah reply 4 this recipe is amazing. the only thing i changed was that i threw some soy sauce into the chicken while sautéing it in the wok along with some dry minced garlic. then i took the thai noodles and sautéed them for about a minute and then put the sauce into them before throwing the rest of the ingredients in together. turned out amazing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal eric w. reply 2 excellent. my only substitution was adding cream of coconut instead of honey to sweeten it a little. as a dip i keep the sauce thick; when i use it with a noodle dish i thin it out a bit with water. had it last night in a lettuce wrap with grilled chicken. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal aznette13 reply 2 an amazingly intense flavor. make at least double the sauce, you won't be sorry. the sauce was thicker than i expected. we used mushrooms instead of broccoli the first time, but made it again with broccoli a week later. both excellent and delicious.<br/><br/>must be eaten with chopsticks to taste right. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal not.knowing.you reply 2 wow was this good!  other than the broccoli (imagine a 50 year old man throwing a fit like a three year old) i stayed true to your recipe.  my optional ingredients, due to no broccoli, were mushrooms and 2 cups of slaw mix.  this was a hit-instructions spot on and i will be making this the next time we have spring rolls and..........thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal diana adcock reply 2"
"loved this fresh new taste! i did not have the chili sauce and i left out the honey, but i added ground red pepper (hot) to the dressing and honey roasted peanuts to the slaw instead.  i think i added more sesame oil to the dressing, because i love the taste.  had some frozen basil and some fresh cilantro--excellent addition to cabbages. this makes a huge batch--perfect for potlucks. if i had chow mein noodles, i think those would be a nice crunch too. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal suse40 reply 3 so good! i made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out delicious. i think it tasted way better the second day! and even the third! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lauramacky reply 1 this is sooo flavorful and so easy to make.  you can use a coleslaw mix from the grocery, but i like mixing it myself because i love napa cabbage and it's not included in a pre-mixed slaw mix.  i like the idea of adding peanuts to the slaw and since i had plenty on hand - that's just what i did.  this is great for a bbq or any family get-together.  made for zwt9. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dailyinspiration reply 1 we loved this slaw!  this was a refreshing change from my normal vinaigrette or yogurt sauce to avoid mayo.  i might double the fresh herbs in the future.  for zwt9 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal random rachel reply 1 made as written, but i halved it. this was a great blend of flavors and very easy to put together. unfortunately, we didn't get to it the night i made it and ended up eating it the next day and so the napa cabbage was a little limp, but it was still quite edible. i think in the future i would add a tad more chili sauce. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal strawberrybird reply 1"
"not only was this meal extremely tasty, it also cured a cold i had for almost a month!  

in case you have trouble finding a few ingredients, here are a few substitution suggestions:

sub 4-5 tbspns ginger for the laos powder

sub 1/2 tspon anchovy paste mixed in 1/8 cup warm water for fish sauce.

sub store bought curry powder for curry paste (but finely chop up 6 serrano chiles and simmmer in hydrated sauce for 8-10 minutes) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal betty spin reply 1 really tasty recipe and super easy! would make a great weekday meal and tastes even better as leftovers! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal limeandspoontt reply great thai green curry, and again, your curry paste is great too.  this curry was very fresh tasting, and nice and spicy.  i used chicken thighs in this which i think add a nice flavor to the broth. it was a big hit with my family last night. i think it makes a big difference to make the paste yourself, so don't skip this step people!  it doesn't take more than a few minutes, and you can do it a few days ahead if you need to.  thanks for another great recipe l4c! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal a la carte reply i could not get this to taste good.  it might have been the curry paste i used, which was maeploy.  the technique for making it seemed to work great, but mine just came out tasting pretty.  i wouldn't attempt to make this again with the same curry paste. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal skeezicks7 reply this was our main meal tonight...it was delicious. i did change a couple of things - i used my own green curry paste (though when i run out i will give yours a try), i stir-fried the paste for a minute or so then added the chicken and stir-fried until it was sealed, then added 400ml coconut milk and 1 cup chicken stock (trying to reduce the calories). i also added 1/2 bunch of chopped coriander at the end. served with jasmine rice and lime wedges. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal fairy nuff reply"
"oh, this was so good!  i made an 8x recipe to take to a large outdoor party (my neighbor has tons of sweet, crisp cukes in his garden) and kept the salad in a large bowl placed in an even larger bowl of crushed ice since it was an outdoor party and the temps were over 90 degrees.  this was the second side to disappear from the buffet table (out of about 14 or 15 dishes) and i received tons of compliments on it.  the flavors were awesome, tart/sweet dressing with the crunch of the cukes and carrots and peanuts.  i'm so glad that i chose this particular recipe to make!  :)  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal eats_healthy reply 3 very good (unique) salad, but make sure you taste the cuke first-- if the peel is bitter then the salad will be as well (in that case, peel it before slicing).

and, really, the cilantro is not optional!  :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal victoria20 reply 1 this is the worst cucumber salad i have ever had. i was shocked. i read the reviews and it sounded like a great recipe. after i finished making it i let it sit tasted it and thought it was awful. i let it sit for a couple hours to let it marinate but it was still awful. i double checked the recipe thinking i made a mistake but that was not the problem. i have been making cucumber salad for a long time. i have always loved it and i thought that trying a new recipe would be an adventure but ultimately just a waist of time, ingredients and money. every thai restaurant i've eaten in has their own recipe. although different, never disappointing. this is my first cucumber salad disappointment. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal fineartpro2000 reply 1 i made this for morher's day but omitted the garlic and onion since my mother cannot stomach those. this was a wonderful summer salad: refreshing and tart with just the right amount of sweetness. i'm a huge fan of cilantro and jalapeños. the peanut garnish on top really added to the dish. thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lshapka reply no fish sauce ? hmmm... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal naughty_pines reply"
"excellent! i put a bit too much dressing on, but it was wonderful all the same. will be making again - thanks to you & your mum!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mellowpuff reply 1 love love love this recipe, been making it for years, but i use left over roast beef cut into thin strips and chinese leaf lettuce icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ninavanton reply this is a delightful salad! i substituted a red onion for the shallot, and didn't use mint this time. i had japanese cucumbers, so didn't seed or peel them. i also had very thinly sliced beef, so i just fried it and used it. two little red thai chilies were just right for me. so easy, and so very very good. thank you very much for posting this lovely recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mianbao reply very, very delicious. not to complicated to make, other than all the cutting. i will definitely make it again. my wife thought it was better than our favorite thai restaurant. very good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal coronajf reply this is a wonderful recipe.  the only change we made was using the lt. brown sugar as we couldn't find palm sugar.  i would have never thought to put fresh mint with the other ingredients, but now that i've tried it i can't imagine eating the dish without it.  this is going into my file of keepers for summer entertaining.  thanks for the recipe, shimmerchk! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal 394mm493 reply"
"i made this recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect! the flavor was incredible. it's a keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 this is awesome. the peanut butter is very subtle and the lime sticks out, which i love. i've made versions of this for years but i think this is my favorite! i ended up using carrot, celery, and cabbage for the vegetable but kept everything else the same. flavorful and healthy, i'll be using this as my go-to coconut curry recipe from now on! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef kirsten 1 reply 1 pretty good, didn't get me excited until i added sriracha. delish! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal alexandrathegreat reply 1 this is great. i added parsnips and a generous squirt of sriracha sauce. another tip - brown the tofu in a hot skillet, so it does not break up in the sauce. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cornip l. reply this was a huge hit in my house. my brother hates tofu and sweet potatoes, but he said that this was one of the best things that i ever made. while i'm a bit curious to see how this would taste with a little more curry paste, i won't be straying from your recipe with this crew. well done sophie. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal college park crazy reply"
excellent green curry paste!  i put everything in the blender and mashed all the ingredients together for about five mins.  i lifted the lid up and when i opened it up the thai aromas wafted out.  smelt just like thailand to me and tasted like thailand.  thank you latchy for nice memories and rip. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef flower reply

"i had the opposite problem of katew - this was delicious but it suddenly went from a flourly liquid to a solid after about 5 minutes of cooking.  it stuck on the bottom and i wasn't prepared to pull if off and onto a greased baking pan at that moment.  the end result really reminded me of mochi, but with a coconut flavor.   when i make mochi i knead the dough after it cooks, so i may try that with this recipe in the future.  i made a half batch and got 25 little pieces - someone could maybe eat 3-4 pieces, so a full recipe would serve at least 12 people. for zwt9 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal random rachel reply i tried this as an experiment as i had milk to use up and rice flour left from making xmas shortbread. it came together fast but needed extra long slow cooking to get rid of the floury chalky texture. you need to stir or whisk non stop because it will catch on the bottom. i used brown sugar not palm sugar and halved the amount and i was 'out' of pandanus leaves !!! next time !!! i got tired of stirring but my daughter took over to get it to a perfect consistency - thick and lustrous. we had no idea of what to expect but i will give 5 stars for an excellent cultural and culinary experience. made for zwt9. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal katew reply"
"i subbed yellow curry paste for the red curry paste, used madras red curry instead of turmeric, added bamboo shoots, and garnished it with the noodle nest and chives, plus plenty of sriracha hot sauce. it was incredible. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal malloryll reply 3 delicious! i substituted veggies for the meat and it turned out great. i think i might try using rice noodles next time. thanks for sharing the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lucky in bayview reply 1 absolutely incredible.  slightly salty for my taste, but it was so good.  i sauteed the chicken in a separate pan after i marinated it in red curry paste and hoise and fish sauce for about 30 minutes.  i also decreased the curry paste by 1 tablespoon, and would probably decrease it another tablespoon to 1 tablespoon.  it was spicy for our guests, though my husband loved the kick.  overall, i will use this recipe again and again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal moonvalleycrab reply 1 i followed the recipe in its entirety, and the soup came out absolutely delicious! definitely, the best soup i have ever had. i recommend to double the ingredients, you will want seconds. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tammybog18 reply 1 this was fantastic.  i added 1 t. fish sauce.  i was serving 6 people and doubled the recipe.  so glad i did; i think the servings suggestions is conservative. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sjrenner reply 1"
"this turned out very yummy. thank you so much for posting the recipe.

just wanted to add, i saw that one of the commentators recommended soaking to rid of ""dye"" because everything turned purple. the purple coloring is the natural color of black rice's husks which are not removed. there's no dye involved. just wanted to throw that out there. thanks again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal siava reply 2 brilliant, used exact measurements and turned out just like the photo however i would have reduced the water by 1/2 cup. excellent recipe!
make sure to use glutinous short grain black rice 
(also known as forbidden rice) 
as this will not work with wild rice :) 

thanks!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kent van heerden reply 1 this is the recipe i've been looking for and had no idea it was so incredibly simple. as another reviewer has posted, i think i'll reduce the water to 3 cups next time. maybe simmering uncovered would do the same thing by boiling off that extra liquid. it's too wet. something i also learned was opening a can of coconut milk, the cream sits on top and if you dump it in straight from the can it's a bit lumpy in the pudding. being cream, i think it will melt a bit if warmed, so that will be one tweak is to steal all the cream and enough milk to make one cup and warm it and stir it smooth before putting it in so it swirls in a bit. but before adding the coconut cream, i think i'm going to also thicken it just a tiny bit with a corn starch slurry and some heat as well and make it extra gooey. i think these changes will replicate my favorite black sticky rice pudding from a restaurant i ate at many years ago in seattle and hold as the gold standard all other thai restaurants failed to meet. thanks for this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dallin f. reply at first, i was uncertain about trying this recipe since it described it as tasting like berries. the final result did have a hint of berry but was not overpowering. in general, this made a flavorful dish that we will certainly be making again. 

i made the recipe as described except that i used 1/4 cup coconut sugar and 1/4 cup organic maple syrup instead of the suggested sugar. 

i also had extra liquid after simmering on low for 2 hours. i removed the lid and stirred for 5 more minutes to boil off the extra. the rice was cooked through and had a great texture. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ryan s. reply this was great! thank you. my boyfriend wanted me to make something with black rice and he absolutely loves coconut milk so this went over great. i think i'll use less water next time, i ended up straining the rice after more than two hours passed and the rice was more than tender enough. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal m.march reply"
"too much vinegar, soy sauce, and lime for my taste. i remade the sauce after making it as directed, but this time added only a splash of vinegar, soy sauce, and lime and was really pleased with the flavor. i will definitely make this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal crazycoconut4404 reply 2 i made it as directed and added bean sprouts as suggested.  it definitely needs the curry and i would add more chilis.  it was okay but i wouldn't make it again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal swiz58 reply this is the best pad thai sauce recipe!  even beats most restaurants in my opinion!  love it with chicken, bok choy, bean sprouts, onion, and sugar snap peas...yum!  thanks for posting!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mcmahan03 reply made this last night and loved it!  i added the curry to the chicken and am glad that i did because it was delicious!  also, i didn't have creamy pb so i used my all natural crunchy and skipped adding peanuts at the end.  also used lots of cilantro, my fav!  thanks so much for the amazing recipe!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal pletcha reply very good and very easy! we doubled the crushed red pepper and it was hot, but that is exactly how we like it.  i left out the onion b/c i am not a fan.  we didn't have any peas either, but i will add them next time.  i added the suggested curry as well.  it filled the house with the scent of so many complex spices.  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sbera007 reply"
"this was really good. (before i rate this any farther, i will just state that the recipe tells you how to make rice powder. i walked around the grocery store for an hour before i realized that!) i did everything according to the recipe except to leave out the red onion as my husband does not like onions. i ground the rice and the lemon pepper in my coffee grinder. this salad has a wonderful tang and spice that is truly addicting and it makes me very happy that this is such a healthy recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flautatime reply 1 i've made this recipe twice now and loved it both times. it makes for a great steak marinade, and the salad dressing is delicious. i did make my own toasted rice powder the first time around because i didn't have it on hand. the second time i used store bought. yum! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal danielle n. reply excellent salad.  i made this using left over ny bbq'd steak. i made dressing and salad as written  and added sprouts.  wonderful for a hot summer day. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adopt a greyhound reply this was an amazing dish. my family loves thai food and this salad tasted just like the ones we order in the resturants!!! i make it with fresh spring rolls and a dipping sauce. it is the best summer meal and so healthy!!! thanks so much for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal smurfette the chef reply followed the recipe for the most part except that my flank steak was already cooked.  i had some leftovers, very rare, and i sliced them up very thinly, made the marinade as it appears, and put the already cooked slices in the marinade for about one hour.   i then followed the rest of the recipe and when i was ready for the beef, i broiled the sliced meat in the marinade under a hot broiler for about 5 minutes until  the meat was sizzling and the garlic was just beginning to turn brown.  i ran out of lime juice for the dressing so i used half lime juice and half lemon juice with great results.  couldn't find palm sugar(what the heck is it anyway! and where do you get it???) so just used regular white sugar.  i also didn't have serrano peppers, but had home grown which are so much hotter that i only used one and it was scorching hot!!!!!  used the lemongrass concentrate from the tube purchased in the produce aisle which another review had used and was pleasantly surprised. also, last but not least, didn't do the rice powder as i had never heard of it before and couldn't find it at two major markets.  didn't miss it at all!!!  instead of the lemon slices, i used grated lemon peel from one whole lemon which i think added something extra.  my cucumber wasn't fresh so i didn't use that either.  even with all those changes, we really enjoyed this salad.  exactly what we pay for at our local thai restaurant and we thought this was even better.  next time will try it with shrimp!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sauce lover reply"

"delicious pudding! i used rice milk and a little more coconut milk like ummbinat to be dairy free. for sweetener i used jaggery and halved the amount because we don't like it very sweet - that was just perfect. will make it again - thanks for posting! made for ramadan tag 2010. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mia in germany reply 1 time consuming but worth it for how good the pudding tastes. i am assuming the rice is cooked covered, correct? substituted dates for golden raisins and jasmine rice for plain white rice. the lemon was not stirred into the pudding but used as a garnish. a delicious combination of flavors especially the nutty red rice and perfumy jasmine. added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom. love the pistachios on top! does help the cook if the ingredients are listed in order. reviewed for ramadan tag. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookgirl reply i really enjoyed this. the pudding has a nice lemon flavour. i did use a bit less lemon zest but it was lemony enough. i grated it on the small side of a box grater. the recipe never says when to add the golden rasins so i decided not to at the end. i can see they would taste good in this, though i think dh would prefer without anyway. i made this without half-and-half because we are dairy free and just added additional coconut milk to be creamy. for the milk i used rice milk which worked fine. i will make this again. made for ramadan tag. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ummbinat reply"
