"i love kimchi and this homemade version is so good! i made it just as directed and it was great! i can't wait to make it again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 seems pretty yummy! have wait a few months and see how it tastes then. didn't have the shrimp sauce. halved recipe and used the rice flour, siracha chile garlic sauce, maybe 2-4tbsp red pepper flakes, and a dab of ginger paste. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef greaneyes reply 1 see 1 reply great base recipe. i also cut the recipe in half.   i didn't use the shrimp sauce and was a bit short of garlic.  i also salted the cabbage directly for about 15 minutes, after doing the saltwater soak bc i like mine a little more wilted.    it really is a very easy thing to make just takes a bit of time.  i have gotten compliments from mil and dh which is saying a lot!   the only thing i will do next time is maybe add a bit of ginger to it.  will be putting this in my recipes for safe keeping. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal grunig reply 1 this homemade version is really good icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal prkandel reply i replaced the shrimp sauce with more shrimp sauce.  added more radish to my second batch.  my exchange student from south korea said it was better than her mom's!  i make this on a regular basis.  the longer it sits the better.  i let mine ferment for at least 5 months before eating.  love adding it to soup! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mrsmeduck reply"
"first time making this soup and all i can say is wow! i'm a huge fan of kimchi and so i wanted to try something new. the soup has great flavor....a nice kick but not too overpowering. i loved it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 good recipe.  i used a lesser amount of kimchee (homemade, extremely spicy, and very sour at three months old) made from chinese cabbage, korean coarse sea salt, daikon, korean coarse dry red chili flakes, ginger root, fish sauce, scallions and lots of garlic).  instead of pork, i made a broth using about a tablespoon of dry, granular, korean fish base which is similar to japanese bonito flakes except much more concentrated.  i slowly stewed the kimchee in this broth using twice the amount of garlic called for in the recipe and a small amount of sesame oil, a teaspoon or so of thai fish sauce, and some shallot when the kimchi was stewed enough.  i put two handfuls of korean rice cakes (a refrigerated rice product cut into coin-shapes available at korean foodstores) into the rather thin broth and cooked according to package directions.  extremely hot (due to my extra spicy kimchi), sour, wonderful. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cpt cas reply 1 i loved this soup!  i am korean, too, so wanted to try another recipe, as we all have different twists on our own home dishes.  this one was so good and i am so glad to see that emily is sharing her recipes for us all!  korean's don""t use recipes and that can be really hard for us who want to learn how to make excellent, authentic korean food! thank you, emily, and please keep making recipes! my mother died before i learned all her recipes, so i'll take any help i can get! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ssan4him reply 1 hi emily,  this soup is to die for and it is a perfect as is.    wow! my family loves it too.  oh,  i have seen this soup mentioned so many times on korean dramas and it looked good so i am glad i found the recipe here to try it.  it is a keeper.  by the way,  i want to try your japanese cheesecake recipe but the ingredients are in oz.  do you happen to have them in u.s measurements like in cups and spoons ? thanks again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal yungb reply 1 really loved this! the only change i made was to use an entire bunch of green onions. next time i will use more kimchee. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flkeysjen reply"
"i would've given this 5 stars if there was a ""complete"" recipe. i had to assume all of the ingredients would be added all at once in the ziploc bag. i don't cook daily so i also had to figure out that mirin rice wine is known as ""sweet cooking rice seasoning"". i was a little worried about how it would turn out, but thank you to everyone else that posted their reviews. the reviews convinced me to go out on a limb. it turned out great!! i deviated some from the recipe. i tripled the recipe because i wanted extra sauce to pour over the rice. i used light soy sauce and chopped instead of minced ginger (had a hard time finding minced). i marinated the meat for at least 8 hours and poured the marinade in a separate pot until i finished cooking the meat, then poured it over the meat and let it boil a little. i will definitely make this again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nisha66 reply 2 that is good for testing...5* fot that and thank you guy icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chefpham reply 1 my husband really loved this.  i made it in a pan, so it didn't get pretty like the picture.  i might grill it next time.  every bite was eaten. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jane49423 reply 1 wonderful and quick recipe.  i made this for little miss (dd) and hubby.  i didn't eat the beef (as i don't eat red meat) so i can't comment on the flavour, but my family loved it.  used the exact ingredients except didn't make the steam rice, but couldn't follow the instructions as it didn't mention what do to with soy sauce, mirin, ginger and sesame oil,  so i combined them all into step two and marinated the beef with all the ingredient.  this recipe took me less then five minutes to prepare. so it's one of those dinners that you could prepare, do your thing and come back in an hour and cook it up within minutes.  the beef cooked less then two minutes each side. served with a green salad.  thank so much for a wonderful recipe casie. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef flower reply 1 see 1 reply this just didnt really do it for me for 2 reasons. #1 the beef doesn't sear bc it's still wet. #2 there is no sauce, you discard it. i made the mistake of not reading the recipe until i was standing over the ingredients getting ready to throw it together so it was too late to back out. i did end up making a sauce out of the marinade  but the meat got overcooked while i was beating it into something my hubby would like. i made stir-fry veggies on the side which i tossed with it. we ate it, but i won't make this again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal grimms restaurant t reply"
"couldn't find cellophane noodles at the grocery store, so i used rice noodles and it was a great dish. the beef was tender and the noodles were great. make this because you'll love it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply loved it! the flavor was perfect. i prefer using ground meat (beef or pork) for this. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal monmamoni reply this was a really outstanding recipe which i can't wait to make again! i changed a few ingredients - i'd highly recommend using kochujang (korean chilli paste), kochugaru (korean red pepper powder) and most importantly the sweet potato starch noodles which are synonymous with japchae or chapchae and have quite a different texture to bean thread noodles. the result was great flavour and texture and a really addictive eat - thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal currybunny reply i was just going to post this recipe when i saw it here.  i got it from a korean cooking class my adoption (my daughter was adopted from korea) agency had.  it is wonderful.  i usually either make my own bulgoki for the meat or for a faster dinner use pre-made from my local korean market.  the sauce is the best and my exchange student from korea said it tasted just like her mom's!
p.s. the carrot and green onion should read 1 cup of each. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mika g. reply easy prep. used udon noodles, which went quite well with the vegetables, and sauce. we enjoyed this. thanks for posting icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kelly in to reply"
"this recipe is truly great, yet i would add change to a quarter cup of toasted sesame seeds and a half a cup more soy sauce. this is a really great way to marinate short ribs, i know this would be great with pork ribs too. don't forget to keep the marinade for basting while cooking on the grill! the marinade is top notch excellent. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sophisticated taste reply 3 i marinated dino ribs in this for a day and a half, then roasted them in the oven for about 2.5 hours as we don't have a grill.  we pulled the meat off and wrapped it in lettuce leaves with condiments.  very good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kasha reply 2 easy and tasty. use this for a large group - it got rave reviews. i pulled back on sugar though and substituted with italian tomato paste - i wanted to add a bit more texture.  wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flaca reply 1 these short ribs were amazing! full of flavor, the marinade is bomb. i served it as recommend with rice and wrapped in lettuce. it's so good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply this was da bomb! we go out for korean bar-b-que all the time, and this recipe tastes just as delish as what we get in the restaurants. it was so easy, what a hit. will be making this marinade again and again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sa w. reply"
this was so good! the chicken was crispy and tender and the sauce is incredible. it's the best part of the recipe! i can't wait to make it again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1
"when i saw this picture just knew i had to try this recipe.  followed the recipe exactly except no mushrooms as i forgot to buy them, wish i had as i know it'd be even better.  we did use flat rice noodles instead of egg and really liked that.  we even used the sriracha sauce and it was wonderful, but you are right it's very hot.  dh has been asking for something like this for a long time and now i've done it.  this was perfect for a cold, chilly day and reheated perfect for the next day too. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bonnie g #2 reply 1 we used chicken breasts.....my homemade spicy kimchee .....no tofu....no mushrooms in the house.and a different noodle.  awesome!!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen in tbay reply changes i've developed: switch out pork for firm tofu--pork is a ""red"" meat and basically unhealthy except in very limited quantities--could use chicken or turkey.  added 1.5 tbsp. sririacha sauce.  this was to suit my palate.  otherwise, very good soup as is too!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bicycler reply i've made this several times now, and love it!! i omit the tofu and use shrimp instead of pork, otherwise, i pretty much follow the recipe exactly. this is perfect for chilly days and/or when you've got a cold. thanks for the great recipe!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mplsgirl reply"
"this turned out great, very tasty! i added 1 teaspoon of rice wine vinegar for a little tang since this tastes like what our local korean bbq uses. we served them at room temperature. thanks so much for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jenlyn reply 8 this is a great basic recipe for bean sprouts! instead of fresh sprouts i used the canned sprouts (drained them first) that you can find at your local grocery store in the oriental section.  i also added a teaspoon of rice vinegar to give it a little tang and serve it chilled. tastes just like the restaurant sprouts. i love to serve this with cucumber salad, steamed rice, and bulgogi! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal drycereal reply 4 i live in korea and was searching for this particular dish; they serve it in a lot of the recipes as one of the side dishes here, and it's so healthy.  plus it's very inexpensive, and veggies in korea still shock me by how pricey they are.  anyhow, it was perfect.  exactly the recipe i was looking for, only it's a cut above the restaurants here with the addition of the pretty green onions and sesame.  thanks for the recipe.  perfect. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal amaplay reply 3 very sesame-y, and very much like what we remember from the korean restaurant we used to frequent when we lived near one.  did add the rice vinegar, as one of the recommenders suggested.  thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lecole54 reply 2 great taste.  super easy.  will be making this over and over. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zuly z reply 2"
"this recipe is great! i ended up using fresh spinach and washing it and squeezing it dry and then cutting it very fine and it worked great. also, i almost forgot to pick up pickled radish at the market! but so glad i remembered, it adds an extra little element that is lacking in other recipes i've tried; (i've even tried a little bit of sauerkraut in place of the radish in a pinch a couple of times and it was actually pretty good). thanks for posting this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal apelsinjuice reply 1 see 1 reply this is exactly the recipe a dear korean friend gave me years ago and it is delish!.  the only notes i would add:  put your seaweed wrap on the bamboo sheet, then top with rice (step 6); seal the roll by dipping your finger in water and running it along the edge then pressing together; wipe your knife off as you're cutting (too sticky will produce sloppy slices); and the radish you're looking for is sold as ""pickled daikon radish"" in stores with a good asian refrigerated section and is a bright yellow color (you don't want to miss this sweet-sour flavor addition in the rolls).  you can also make your own by purchasing daikon radishes and pickling them yourself... i like the recipe for sweet pickled daikon radish here on food.com  (#419414).  enjoy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal farrangel reply 1 top icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal martin k. reply this was my first try at rice rolls and i haven't mastered rolling it tight enough yet, but tasted delicious. i added a teaspoon of sake to my eggs and i couldn't find pickled yellow radish (never had it and don't know what it's like), but fresh daikon radish worked great. wonderful combination of veggies. the frozen spinach works really well, but you have to make sure you get it squeezed out really well. the only change i would make next time is to double the soy sauce. thanks for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal littleturtle reply it was really tasty, expecially the dark sesame part. the only flaw i found with it consists of the rice not having enough taste. i also added an extra teaspoon of sesame oil and soya sauce to the spinach, and it was delicious. also a great thing that affects how delicious it is depends on the seaweed. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ipriscilla reply"
"oh my gosh, i love this stuff!! cant get enough. thanks so much for adding this recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mm margoulette reply i heated my stone bowl in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour.  before adding ingredients to the bowl, i brushed in a small amount of sesame oil.  this meat mixture tastes awesome!!!  it would make a great mixture for egg rolls or dim sum. great recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nmcocina reply"
"had this for dinner with a fried egg on top and it was so good! not too spicy at all. loved the nori topping with sesame seeds. it gave it a nice finishing touch. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 wonderful! one of my favorite things at a korean bbq restaurant is when they make the kimchi rice with the leftovers, right at the table! while it's much better with the crunchy bits from the hot bbq, this was a very close second and we'll definitely be making this again! thanks for posting - this is a keeper! made for swt 2019. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jostlori reply 1 this was fabulous, and it was so easy to prepare. i used a (store bought) spicy kimchi, and i thought it added a lot of flavor to the fried rice without being overwhelming with ""heat"". i'll definitely make this again. (i forgot to add the green onions until after i snapped my photo....oops!) if served the kimchi fried rice with (your) bulgogi - korean beef bbq and a side dish of soy & sesame spinach, and it was a wonderful korean-themed dinner. thanks for sharing your recipe, pannan. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal northwestgal reply 1 i used hot kimchi and the gochujang paste and it was hot! good thing i cut this down to one serving because everyone else is wimpy. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sheepdoc reply 1 i thought that this was absolutely delicious! i'm already craving it again. i used homemade kimchi and it was still super easy to put together. i thought it was very flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. i really recommend using the nori sheet, as it adds depth of flavor to the finished dish. made for the seoul food challenge - susie's world tour - korea icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lifeisgood reply 1"
"the short ribs were soft and falling off the bone. i served it with rice and it was perfect. can't wait to make it again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 this recipe was easy to make and soooo....delicious! i will definitely make them again. thank you for sharing it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal pjags2234 reply i won't award stars because i made this as a crock pot recipe - everything in the pot cooked on low for 5 hours. it worked.  i put the asian pears on top and they still had a bit of crispness left in them.  i enjoyed the recipe but my friend did not.  i think the majority of people will rave about it.  thanks for posting icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bergy reply i'd give this one more than 5 stars if that were possible! it's easily prepared and very tasty. the asian pears really add a nice dimension...i use them in asian dishes whenever possible. i used bone in short ribs and dry sherry. i think this would be good with baby back pork ribs, too. i'll give it a try and let you know. thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal greg in san diego reply"

"the korean name for this dish is dak dori tang.  i was born in korea and spent 3 years there as an adult between the 2 air force bases there.  you can find this in korean restaraunts in the us and throughout korea (in the hibachi style/cook in front of you restaraunts).  you can also add the clear noodles to the potatoes, and carrots!  definitely one of my favorites! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal leilanis mommy reply 2 this is my second recipe to use on this site.  my wife is korean and i think she was a bit shocked at how good it tasted.  in the past i have just guessed at ingredients and did ok.  it's nice to have a site like this that allows people to vote on how good something is.  a recipe is a recipe is a recipe and i am sure nobody puts one up thinking it is trash.  this system and this dish is perfect.

thanks. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal allratings reply 2 these were some of the best wings i've ever made. they weren't super spicy but rather had a nice flavor and kick. make them because you'll love them just as much! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 yum, j!  i used chicken drumettes and red bell pepper just out of personal preference.  this was so tremendously easy, i was able to try three other of your recipes for the first time for a complete korean meal. (all your recipes are easy!!!) :)  it was so delicious!!! served with rice, spicy pepper steak #33347, sesame spinach #30471, and spicy cucumbers #30457. i wish i would have braved your recipes earlier.  we'll be having korean night in our house now regularly. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ginnyp reply 1 very easy and delicious! it reminded me of an asian style chicken cacciatore. i used a whole cut up chicken, rather than wings because that's what i had on hand. other than that, followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rachelt reply"
"we love going to a korean bbq restaurants. this recipe was great, simple to put together and little miss and hubby (i don't eat read meat) said it tasted wonderful.  i followed the recipe except i used chives instead of spring onions/green scallions, it was all i had a home and i wanted to use them before they expired.  hubby said all the elements to the dish went really well together (the lettuce rub, the soy/sesame scallions/chives and the beef). i double the recipe and served it as a main with rice, kimchi and cherry tomato salad.  thank you so much for a simple dish elmotoo icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef flower reply 2 wonderfully fresh and crisp tasting dish and i loved the flavour that came through from the sesame oil and seeds. the slight bite of the chili combined with the lettuce was great as well. i had a fresh red chili that needed using so used that finely diced instead of the powder which also added a little extra texture to the mix. rather than slice the steak especially thinly i left it somewhat thick because i was serving as a main course so used less lettuce per serve but the same quantities of everything else. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal peter j reply 2 this was just what i was craving. although my kids went running for water!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal djmastermum reply 1 ok... i am giving this recipe 5 stars even though i haven't tried it and here is why. in high school i had a friend named cory who's father was korean, and would make this exact dish for us on nights we had study dates. it was the most delicious, out of control meal. i was over the moon to find this recipe, it will very soon become one of my regular staples... thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adam and nicci reply 1 oh my gosh did i love this one. i knew i was in for a treat and i was not disappointed. the marinade is to die for. i'm a massive fan of san choy bow and thought this was an interesting play on the idea. but this beats it hands down. thanks so much elmotoo i can't wait to have ppl over and serve this to them. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal calms79 reply 1"

my family loved this noodle recipe. it is absolutely super spicy but the flavors are so yummy its addictive. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cherie d. reply 1 see 1 reply i'll start with saying that we thoroughly enjoyed the end result. i made a couple of changes though. i reduced the heat due to personal preference and we found it perfect. i was baffled by the amount of water listed and didn't know if it was 1/2 cup of water with the noodles plus 1 1/2 cups. the 1/2 cups (plural) had me wondering if it was a typo or if there really should only be 2 cups of water in total. i went with 4 cups as indicated on the package directions. i also couldn't imagine cooking instant ramen noodles for 7 minutes so again turned to the package and cooked it for the 3 minutes as indicated there. the eggs were not part of this recipe and something that we just happen to like in our noodle bowls. i'll definitely make it again. thank you for posting it! made for susie's world tour 2019. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal k9 owned reply see 1 reply
"so simple, quick, and delicious. the green onion is not a must, chopped yellow or white onions work fine. after making this about 10 times, i now put all the ingredients in a gallon size plastic bag the day before and marinate it overnight. i increased the amounts of garlic and ginger. the first time i made it, some of the sauce burned a bit, so i cut back the oven temp to 325-350 and just cook it a bit longer. delicious every time and never get tired of it. my 16 y.o. daughter's favorite. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal johnbrills reply 33 i made this 2 times within 4 days. the 1st time i used bone in thighs with skin and it was good but the 2nd time i used boneless skinless thighs and marinated for 2 hours and it was phenomenal!!!!! my husband was beside himself and made noises all throughout the meal :o) i was so proud because not only was it awesome, it looked just beautiful! i garnished with green onion and served over white rice with eggrolls. i have been telling anyone who will listen how fantastic this recipe is!
my hubby said it was in the top 5 all time awesome meals i have cooked! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal canny1975_11689607 reply 21 this was really good. i took out a package of bone-in, skin on chicken thighs out of the freezer, there were five pieces in the bag. i let them thaw over night, mixed up the sauce ingredients in the morning, with a few changes, didn't have honey, so i used brown sugar, sprinkled some hot pepper flakes for zing, and i did not use three tablespoons of sesame oil. i would never use three tablespoons of sesame oil in anything. it would be totally overwhelming.  i used just one tablespoon.i don't normally have such a strong opinion but i made the mistake once, in a marinade for grilled salmon. i couldn't go near sesame oil for two years. i poured the sauce ingredients into the bag with the chicken and left it all day in the fridge. baked as directed, turning twice, once every twenty minutes, ending with skin side up, and turned the broiler on the last five minutes or so to crisp up the skin as another reviewer suggest. served with white rice. they were excellent! moist and tender and not too salty at all. thanks so much! i love fast and simple, these were great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nougat reply 13 see 1 reply oh wow!  i had been eyeing this recipe for nearly a week, as i had some frozen thighs, desperate to be prepared.  after reading through all of the reviews numerous times, i tweeked only a few things.  i did end up marinating the thighs, overnight.  i used a ginger-infused soy sauce [i think fresh ginger would have definitely punched it up quite a few notches], a pinch and a half of brown sugar, and a shake of red pepper flakes.  i scaled it down to two thighs, baked for thirty minutes before turning, and ten more afterwards.  i have never roasted such moist chicken, ever.  the flavor was delicious, and everyone was quite pleased.  thank you so much for unfreezing my chicken thighs! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal froggus. reply 8 this has become one of my go-to recipes. it is great! i prefer skin off, bone in thighs. i usually cut down on the soy sauce and replace some of it with water or use low sodium soy sauce. i also add red pepper flakes or cayenne to give it some kick.<br/>absolutely delicious over rice! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephiefae reply 7 see 1 reply"

"my son gave this 5 stars.  hubby gave it a 4.5 (he likes to leave room for improvement).  i used some salsa that needed to be used up in place of one of the cans of tomato sauce and half a bag of a stale tortilla chips in place of the tortillas. the only thing i had trouble with is the amount. there wasn't enough to feed all 4 of us let alone 6 to 8 people but then again, my boys are hogs by nature. lol.  thanks for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hunkle reply i wasn't sure how this would turn out when i was cooking it since the sauce was so liquidy. i was pleasantly surprised when it was done cooking though. very yummy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mlhutmacher reply"
