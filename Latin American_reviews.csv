"this might be a wonderful soup, i can't say either way. but this is definitely not ajiaco! it is missing quite a few extremely important ingredients that give ajiaco its traditional flavor (guascas). and it has quite a few extra ingredients no colombian person would ever dream of putting on this dish! so i would recommend food.com change the name of this recipe, it is widely inaccurate. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jaleito18 reply 3 see 1 reply i absolutely loved this soup. as a previous reviewer mentioned, although there are very simple ingredients in the soup, it's packed with a lot of flavor. definitely making this again soon! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 this recipe is missing a lot of the original ingredients from colombia such as criolla potatoes, guascas, red potatoes, etc... and the original recipe does not call for yucon root!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal labe82 reply 1 this is awesome! i have never had it before. and was thinking for its simplicity it would be plain, as i love spice. but it isnt. perfect for my non spice liking 7 year old too! thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gracielagata reply 1 my dad grew up in colombia and when we were growing up he used to make this every new year's eve.  i made this this weekend, and it was just as i remember it!  thanks for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal allergygirl reply 1"
"call it what you want (i know...technically it's pernil.  my boyfriend is puerto rican too!) - but i call it the ""5 hours of torture roast"".  it fills the house with such a tantalizing aroma that you swear you will lose your mind obsessing over the timer!  thanks for posting this.  awesome! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal shayoliver reply 10 this was incredibly delicious.  i used a small, <3 lb. roast, and marinated it only 3 hours.  i used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 12, but the rest of the ingredients were as written.  i cooked it at 300 for 3 hours, covered and then at 350 for 45 min. uncovered.  very moist and tender. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal magsmeals reply 9 okay, so this might be the only way i'll be making pork shoulder from now on. that garlic marinade is out of this world! i let it marinate in the fridge over night and wow. it made the whole house smell great while it cooked! leftovers will become tacos, and i can't wait! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 7 see 1 reply oh, incredible pork roast.  i saw this recipe over on tasty kitchen and just made it today, and it is the most perfect pork i have ever eaten.  i used half the salt and cooked it in the crockpot on low while we were at work, and it was just swimming in juice and falling apart when we got home.  my husband went nuts.  he had some on noodles and i had some on a sourdough bun, and we both had to stop ourselves from taking more than we needed.  an absolute keeper, and highly recommended. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal erin r. reply 7 this is just the best pork recipe i have ever tasted.  i followed the directions exactly as stated.  i am just not sure what cut of meat i had but it said picnic on it.  even a terrible cook like me could not ruin this roast.  thank you so much for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal metritek reply 6"
"oh my goodness!!!! can i just say what an amazing dinner these make!! the technique for this recipe is a brut to master, but well worth the effort. my boyfriend is from el salvador so i made these for him as a token of my love. he said that my papusas were better than his grandmothers. ""she uses too much beans"" he says. cheese is the  melody and the beans are the beat. a couple of tips i pioneered on because i didnt have lorocco for the cheese, i used fresh jalapenos minus the seeds instead. for the beans, use raw bagged red beans, and add some garlic, a couple of bay leaves and salt while boiling the beans. the beans take about an hour on a medium simmer, adding more water when needed and stirring occasionally. i also had a bit of difficulty with the rolling of the cheese and beans in a single tortilla. they looked like biscuits, and didnt fry well. try rolling a small thick tortilla from masa on parchment paper, spreading a nice layer of cheese, a dallop of beans, leave about a 1/4 of an inch from the edge then place another small thick tortilla on top, then press close the tortillas edges with the fork. with another piece of parchment on top, flatten the pupusa with a plate or a rolling pin until its about 1/3 of an inch thick together. for 4 cups of masa, use about 3 1/2 cups of hot water, but add gradually, start about a half cup at a time, and mix with your hands as you go. the consistency will tell you when it is ready. it will be firm, like bread dough. dont forget the curtido and salsa!!! these are crucial and absolutely decadent!! they arent the same the next day after an overnighter in the refridgerator, so if you made too many, share the weath with a neighbor. they will never complain about your music being too loud ever again. this is a truely lovely recipe and i am greatful to the original poster of this culinary masterpiece. thank you, thank you, thank you!!! giggity yummerz!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal giggitygoodcook reply 4 these were awesome! i have never eaten or made pupusas....yes the recipe is time consuming, however definitely well worth it....i did add more hot peppers to the curtido...i like it hot! the actual dough was difficult to work with so i made two very flat ""discs"" as suggested on an earlier review, and put them together which looked better and worked out well....thank you for an awesome recipe...(my husband has had authentic pupusas in the past and he said mine were definitely the best) i would suggest to anyone trying these for the first time to make the salsa and curtido....just as recipe states! thanks again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal glory to god reply 3 i love pupusas!!!  i just came back from a month long stay in el salvador and wanted to make this traditional dish for my family.  this recipe is a very good representation of pupusas.  thank you for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal superblondieno2 reply 3 tas-tee! ours turned out quite horrid looking compared to the salvadorian restaurant at which we've had our first and only pupusas, but the flavor was right on the money. i would venture to say that this isn't a ""beginner"" recipe in terms of manual construction, but we found that layering the filling between two masa ""discs"" was slightly easier than forming the edges of one layer up and over the filling and then sealing it closed. i'm sure the difficulty of this task is specific to one's experience... ;)  i think the key lies in getting the right level of moisture in the masa dough because if it dries out slightly while forming, you're going to get cracks through which the filling will leak. next time we're going to cheat and just lay the filling mixture on top of the masa disc -- same flavor, a lot less work for us lazy bums. for the cheese mixture, i had to use what i had on hand which turned out really good! -- shredded mozzarella, a mexican blend of shredded cheeses, minced bell pepper and minced pepperoncini. there was way too much leftover cheese, but it was so good, we're going to use it for something else. all in all a delicious and authentic-tasting version of a favorite, especially served with recipe #139725. thank you so much for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sandi from ca reply 3 all around the unfarmiliar faces icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal the b. reply 1"
"hello! i'm from costa rica!! the recipe is just fine, just the way we make it here! to add an extra touch you can use also chopped red bell pepper. we usually eat this for breakfast as it is a very filling dish. the best gallo pinto is made with left over beans, not freshly made ones. an other important observation; we don't exactly use worcetershire, we use a local version of it called salsa lizano, a very traditional sauce, made by a local family, which resembles worcestershire, you can find it in the internet on costarican sites. it's great with sourcream or scrambled eggs. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tatilu reply 7 see 1 reply excellent side for a latin inspired stir fry i made tonight.  the only things i did differently was to add a bit of stock with the rice because my rice was a tad dry, the juice of half a lime and salt and pepper to taste. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kitchenslave03 reply 6 hi guys i'm glad you like our gallo pinto i think gallo pinto from costa rica has different taste so you have to find similar rice and beans central american use, our rice is more dry (no sticky) and our beans are kind of hard and little finally i found products to make it similar in in us fist rice:riceland"" beans: ""centralamerican"" goya ticos hardly use ginger, cumin or all that stuff we use: canola or olive oil, onions, red sweet pepper, cilantro or culantro, consomÃ© de pollo (powdered chicken bouillon--no chicken broth). and very very important the stuff that gives that lovely flavor is ""salsa lizano"" there's in ""bravo"" supermarket or even you can get it on amazon! hope that helps pura vida maes! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal trigo h. reply 3 see 1 reply i have only just now downloaded the recipe, so i cannot comment on this particular version's merits yet. however, i look forward to trying it.<br/><br/>we were lucky enough to live in costa rica for about six months in the late 1980s. in our experience, when you ate breakfast in a restaurant, this was what you were served 99% of the time. obviously, each cook had their own variation, however it was always very good, and sometimes absolutely outstanding. so i suggest you keep tweaking it and looking for variations until it is truly a remarkable dish. which this may be to begin with. we tried to duplicate it in our own kitchen, while we lived there. but, we were never completely happy with it. this recipe looks like it might supply the missing ingredients.<br/><br/>there was a particular local brand of steak sauce, sort of halfway between hp sauce and worcestershire sauce, that we suspected was an important ingredient.<br/><br/>we were on a very limited budget and only ate at very economical restaurants. the sort of place that the lower income costa ricans ate. gallo pinto was always the primary breakfast suggestion and at mid day, the businessman's special, or blue plate special, the lunch of the day, was always a plate with a serving of white rice and a serving of black beans and an entrÃ©e in the middle of the plate and a side of chopped salad on the plate. so, it is no mystery where they get their white rice and black beans. but the way they combine them can be absolutely magical with the right chef. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sailordave43 reply 2 this was very delicious.  i thought the w sauce might be overpowering but i used 3 tablespoons and the flavours blended wonderfully!  i used one can of black beans and the ratio of beans to rice was great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal trishypie reply 2"
"i am 100% cuban, and cilantro is not used in any cuban cuisine. this version tasted good, but tastes nothing like traditional ropa vieja. to those who do not know, puerto rican, mexican, dominican, peruvian, and cuban food are not at all the same. they use different spices, and flavor profiles. it is beyond insulting that so many don't know the different. cilantro? really? google even knows better. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal minnie f. reply 5 see 6 replies just like i remembered frm childhood! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gingerlyj reply 2 this dish is delicious!!! made it for dinner tonight. my meat and potatoes husband loved it! served it with most excellent mexican rice and pico de gallo on the side. this one is a keeper. thanks for the great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal saltyprior reply 2 i grew up eating ropa vieja all the time, and this one is as close to the real deal as you can get. i love that the slow-cooker does all the work! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 i made this exactly as posted, cooking on low for 8 hours. the meat shredded beautifully. very flavorful and real comfort food. served over yellow rice. made by a feed bag for susieâs world tour 2019. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jackieohno! reply 1"

"to anyone making this cake, or any tres lehes cake, instead of poking it with a fork to absorb liquid, i simply turn the cake over on alumminum foil straight out of the oven and let it cool completely. when it is done cooling the top of the cake comes off and exposes the top. i then soak it and it absorbs the milk beautifuly. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal 379576 reply 4 see 1 reply wow!!!  i love this recipe.  my knowledge of tres leches was limited to seeing one on good eats on the food network.  i am so glad i decided to make one.  everyone i shared this cake with wanted the recipe.  i made one slight change in the preparation.  i did not have kahula so i upped the vanilla and added some almond extract.  this is one recipe i intend to make again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lier4064 reply 2 this was such an easy cake to make. i've seen some tres leches cakes where you have to separate the eggs but this was straight forward and so much easier. it turned out great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 this cake was fantastic.  instead of kahlua or coffee (not a fan), i added bailey's irish cream.  mmmmmmmm.  i served it with the whipped cream on the side and presented it with bowls of strawberries, blueberries and rasberries and let my guests make their own combination.  it was a huge hit. 

to get the milk into the cake, initially, i used a pastry brush then realized that it would suck up liquid fairly quickly, but i did pour it slowly, all around the edges and the middle.  i didn't want to lose that moisture. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal seaton1 reply 1 hi. this was a request of a friend of my son. i had never heard of it before. looking it up, this one sounded to be the most simple to make. this is an amazing cake and will always be a favorite now. the taste was unbelievable and we loved it. our friend was thrilled to have this for her birthday! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ainsleys and jacks reply 1"
"this sauce is to die for! i made it with about a tbsp. of cocoa powder instead of the chocolate and i cooked chicken breast in it. served with rice and peas it is a beautiful meal. i will definitely make it again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bauline baker reply 5 this was my first experience making mole sauce, and i must say that it turned out pretty well!  i think the chocolate flavor was just a bit strong, so i would reduce that next time, but other than that i loved it!  i served it in pork wraps with guacamole, cheese and sour cream.  thanks l! :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal canarygirl reply 4 way too much chocolate! there are only a couple of versions of mole sauces that use any chocolate at all: mole negro, mole poblano, and mole coloradito, and none use this much chocolate for such a small batch. typically, they use the same amount of chocolate as used here (2 oz), but to make a gallon or more of sauce, not a mere 3 cups. mole is not chocolate sauce, the chocolate simply adds aroma and a little sweetness. people erroneously call it ""chocolate sauce"" due to a lack of knowledge of the recipe. they see the dark colour and get a faint whiff of chocolate and call it ""chocolate sauce"", not understanding that the dark colour comes not from the tiny bit of chocolate added to the sauce at the last minute, but from the dark purple gajillo peppers used in the actual preparation of the sauce. four out of the seven typical versions of mole: mole manchamantel, mole amarillo, mole verde, and mole chichilo, use no chocolate whatsoever. where are the gajillo, ancho, and chipotle chilies? just chili powder? honestly, i can't imagine any mexican restaurant using a sauce even remotely similar to this.this review is based upon training at the c.i.a. in ny., and 24 years as a sous chef and a head chef. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gordon s. reply 3 like the flavor overall and smells fantastic. bottom line its to sweet. if you like sweet chili you would be fine with this. i never thought i would like mole sauce and have had several that i liked. its hard for me to wrap my head around putting chocolate sauce on savory food. the moles i like are not sweet. going to give this another try with unsweet chocolate. by the way my secret for great chili includes unsweet chocolate. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gimpysmagic reply 3 see 1 reply excellent. it's not absolutely perfect, but the taste is right. i used cocoa (almost 2 tb) and put it through the blender when it was done cooking. i should have cooked it down further than i did, and used less salt, but it is very good and i think i will cook some chicken in the leftovers. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal donut chef reply 2"
"loved it!!!!  i have been wanting these for years since my favorite bakery on the west coast closed some 15 years ago and use to make these. i bought one with a cup of coffee everytime i went in... sometimes several times a week. a few changes i had to make to this recipe to suit my palette: i split the butter requirement to 1/2 butter flavored crisco and 1/2 butter.  i baked them on a silpat and made the buns 1/4 the recommended size so they were dinner roll size. perfect. and i added 1/4 cup of cocoa, 1 tsp of vanilla, and one pack of instant espresso to the topping mix   1 tbs of water.  i had to lower the oven temp to 325 degrees and bake for 11 minutes in order to keep the bottoms from over baking on my silpat,  and the topping from melting off or getting too crunchy from too high of heat. the topping should not be crunchy!!!  needless to say i had to throw away the first batch due to too hot an oven, but the subsequent batches were fabulous!!  took some to the neighbors since i had too many, and they devoured them on the porch! hahah! super yum. can't wait to make them again for family.  tip alert:  the longer they have to do the 2nd rise the better.  i baked in batches and the 3,4 and 5th batch got better and better, puffier and pillowy soft.  thanks!!!!!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal indimom1976 reply 5 amazing! my first time ever and they came out great. making my second batch today and replaced the butter in the dough to lard (sounds nasty but us mexicans use it often) and i kneaded the dough a lot more. also, the topping came out like a sticky paste..hope thats correct! i was able to spread it after dipping my fingers in a little bit of water. i got the approval of my abuelita and all my tias so this recipe was amazing. one of these with a cup of abuelitas hot chocolate and ive died and gone to heaven! simple and amazing recipe. thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mexicanbettycrocker reply 3 great recipe! i customized and used food coloring. for the flavors i used almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder and cinnamon, and vanilla extract. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ashley d. reply 1 this is a wonderful recipe, however, next time i may add a bit more sugar to bread dough. concha interior was perfect, but i may reduce bake time a few minutes or just turn pan 1/2 way thru bake as some came out browner than i wanted. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal o.c. momma reply 1 i made these today and they turned out great.  much better tasting than the bakeries.  i used my kitchen aid mixer to mix the ingredients and then switched it to the dough hook.  i let the dough rise for the amount mentioned.  i prepared the topping about 30 minutes prior to the completion time of dough rise.  i divided the dough into 12 equal parts and covered each of the dough balls with the paste/dough type topping.  instead of placing the ball on the dough and pressing down as mentioned, i rolled the topping dough into ball in my hand and then pressed it down while i had it on my hand, i then covered bread dough with it.  i scored the top and let it rise on the cookie sheet for about 40 minutes.   i was surprised to see that in fact the topping does indeed separate as the dough rises for the final time.  i have a convection oven so i had the temparture about 300 degrees because my oven tends to run hotter.  the sweetbread baked in about 15 minutes.  the sweetbreads are still soft now even after 3 hours out of the oven unlike the bakery kind that turn hard right away.  the topping was not too sweet but i will add more sugar next time as i would've liked the topping to have been sweeter.  this was a great recipe and thank you for sharing.  will be making these a lot more often. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal baker flo reply 1"
"these were amazing! at first they were really hard, like crackers, but after i added the dulce de leche and let them sit for a while they were wonderfully soft and chewy. they had a very unique taste and were pretty easy to make. i think the baking time was a little too long, though. the ones i left in for 15 were a little burnt and the ones i kept in for 10-12 were much better. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kat mccallister reply 2 these cookies are great.  i made them for a south american themed wine tasting we hosted.  everyone raved about them.  i loved the lemon contrasting with the sweetness of the cookie.i baked them a little less than the stated time and they were nice and soft.  i will be making these again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hilarys_1332 reply 1 these are delicious cookies toni. very tasty, light, fluffy, tender, fragile, dry, sweet and sinfully good. the dulce de leche is a perfect foil for this cookie. they compliment one another perfectly. i love the lemon in this unique cookie. i made mine on the large size, cooked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect. thanks so much for sharing this great recipe, which will be on my christmas trays this year. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal baby kato reply 1 i rarely eat cookies but i couldn't resist going back to the cookie tray for these. made using recipe#234433 which made for an over the top filling. ovens vary mine were done in about 12 minutes. can't wait to serve these to family and friends - having only made a small batch - there's little chance that is going to happen with this making! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gerry reply 1 being the chocoholic that i am, imagine my horror when i found myself craving these addictive little cookies over my favorite chocolate chip comfort cookie.  from the beautifully delicate, lemon tinged cookie itself to the sweet, gooey goodness of the dulce de leche, i'm not sure it could get any better than this and still be legal!  used nestle's la lechara dulce de leche for the filling and it worked better than i had hoped.  in fact, they were so good that after the holidays i received requests from numerous friends for more.  they also told me that these cookies were so good it made them wonder if i'd added crack as a ""special"" ingredient just to get them hooked!  nope, no crack, just a really, really great recipe.  many thanks, toni, for a new family favorite! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lostinca reply"

"loved this cake! made as a birthday cake. what a great alternative to the usual ""frosted"" birthday cake (the birthday boy is not too fond of frosting). the orange taste waas not overpowering. i made a nice decorative powdered sugar design on top which made this cake taste and look good. thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef sarita in aust reply if  you like orange cake, you will love this one. it is not hard to make either icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef oz reply i'm putting this in my power point for school! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal marissa_tanaka123 reply"
"the masa dough needs alot more than just lard for naca tamal.  the filling also is a little off - there's no peas in naca tamal - i think you saw capers, because that is what goes in, with bell pepper one slice across the top before you fold it - your recipe is also missing the sweet part (this is why they taste so different from mexican tamales because they are not full of chile - instead they are sweet and savory mix.  in naca tamales, there is always either 1 - prune or 2 - golden raisin.  usually there is no cilantro or chipotle salsa in them either - it is diced tomatoes, onions and a little garlic - but this is personal taste.  so, if you make the recipe exactly like this shows then go to an authentic nicaraguense restaurant you will see its completely different. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal armenianmama reply 1 see 1 reply i've never made tamales before but this recipe was very easy to fallow and the ingredients were pretty simple. i haven't tasted them yet but they smell great. i'll let you know what they taste like. i used garbanzo beans and chicken so they will be a little different than the recipe here but i'm sure they will be a hit. i'm making them for my boyfriends birthday but i think i'm gonna eat one before everyone gets here. thanx bunches icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jojobeaner reply"
"i'm from the usa and have lived in panama now for about 3 months.  i have had sancocho several times, some good, some not so good.  panamanian-canadian angel's recipe is delicious!  i didn't have broth so used water and added otoe as well.  very tasty and heart-warming soup. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal 2suitcasesandaguy.c reply 1 we've never had sancocho before, so can't rate it based on authenticity.  but this soup was fantastic!  considering how common the ingredients were (other than the yucca) we thought we might have to kick it up a bit. but we were so wrong!!!  from the moment the chicken went into the pot to sweat, the aroma was incredible.  and once it was in the bowl...   yum!  dh couldn't stop saying how good it was.  the only bit of excitement came when i dropped a piece of the raw yucca on the floor (it is so hard to slice!) and our rotty nabbed it and ran out the door with it.  all of a sudden it flashed in my mind that raw yucca is toxic.  i finished up putting the yucca in the pot with the chicken and went to google the subject - and found out that yucca needs to be cooked without the toxic root, which is the part down the middle of the yucca. and it was already in the pot!!!  needless to say, we didn't waste it and took our chances.  i'm happy to report that we're all three still alive and kicking...  lol!  but the center of the root was fibrous and next time i'll prep the yucca correctly (and keep the dog outside!).  thanks for posting this marvelous recipe!  made for spring pac 2013. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jostlori reply 1 los padres de mi novio hacen esta sopa y ellos son de panamÃ£Â¡. esta receta es perfecta y aÃ£Âºtentica!-----my boyfriend's parents make this soup and they are from panama. this recipe is perfect and authentic!  the only difference is that this doesn't have the corn on the cob which i think is a great element to the soup.  otherwise, perfectisimo! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lareinita reply 1 if possible to find, sancocho should be made with Ã±ame, not yucca. but i know that's hard to find in many places. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal valeriewhiting reply"

although in venezuela this is a christmas food, i will be making it all year round. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stereo mike reply 2 good recipe which i followed last year (but by cutting all the ingredients in half).  this year i forgot to half the amount and ended up with way too much dough.  makes it hard to roll it as fine as you need to (just not enough surface in our kitchen).  also weighs a ton!

"a tasty snack not possible to eat just one. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal b2376 reply 1 these were absolutely superb, a perfect appetizer or party dish.  i added some paprika to the dough for color and flavor, and used haloumi, a greek/cypriot cheese that doesn't melt when fried.  it was heaven, perfect for chanuka when fried foods are the major food on the menu! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mirj2338 reply 1 crispy cheese fingers... tasty, cheese, creamy, great with dip!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal samuel holden reply 1 would like to have seen temp of oil and length of time for cooking stated in recipe. also would like flour measure in cups. needed much more water than called for to make dough. 
next time would wrap lengthwise to use less dough per cheese stick, rather than around in ""mummy fashion"". ours tasted heavy with oil -- perhaps correct temp or time of cooking would help that. we used 1/2 wheat flour -- not good. next time 100% white/ unbleached. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mndyoung reply while kneading, i had to add a lot more than a tablespoon or two of water. also, you could feel a lot of oil in th mix. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ramon miquilena reply"
"this is really good,  the potatoes are delicious, but the star of this recipe is the sauce!!!  i will be making it for other dishes, too.  would be great on pasta or rice, and on chicken breasts!  i also used chili oil and paprika, because i didn't have time to look for the annatto oil.  it is available here in some specialty markets and will get some for next time.  thanks for another keeper, marra! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal outta here reply i really enjoyed this dish! my dh loved the cakes, and i enjoyed them with the sauce. thanks marra! made for zwt4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sharon123 reply this was good although i wasn't fond of the sauce. didn't need the extra oil for frying and after reading the reviews and making a different recipe of llapingachos, i just shaped them into balls and watched it go flat as it fried. thanks for letting us try this. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal pneuma reply we loved these.  i made the full recipe, intending to only fry a few potato cakes for our dinner tonight and leaving the rest for company coming over tomorrow.  they were so good we had a second batch - so less for friends tomorrow!  what a shame! 
subbed guyere for muenster and used paprika and a little turmeric instead of annatto oil. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ronanz reply i love any kind of potato cake, and these little babies were no exception.  i couldn't find annatto oil, and instead substituted 1 tablespoon chipotle chillis in adobo sauce, with 5 tablespoons olive oil.  i also had to substitute edam cheese for the muenster.  still very good though, and didn't seem like there was anything missing.  made smaller, these would be great on a buffet table, served either with the sauce on top, or at the sides.  thanks marra mamba, for posting this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ppaperdoll reply"

"very tasty, nice presentation, and quite easy to prepare. (except for the butterflying. next time i'd get that done at the butcher shop.) i used skirt steak, but with the marinating and slow cooking, it was plenty tender. i also substituted grated carrots, and added a couple of spoons of tomato sauce in the marinade. i think i would include a bay leaf next time, and it could support a little more spinach, if you happen to like spinach. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal realbirdlady reply this was a very different/out of the ordinary meal which we enjoyed. i halved the recipes with few problems but i did have trouble rolling it all up together - however i think this may have been my inexperience with butterflying the flank steak and i also think my steak was a bit smaller than called for in the recipe. thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ellie_ reply"

"ceviche is one of my favorite dishes, and this is a great recipe. a couple of notes: peruvian cuisine uses many different peppers. aji amarillo (literally yellow pepper) is peruvian and quite flavorful but does not provide a lot of heat. i don't think aji amarillo will spice up this dish, though. the acid in the lime will overpower it. traditionally, peruvian ceviche uses aji rocoto which is a very hot red pepper, also indigenous to peru. it is closer in heat to the habanero pepper the recipe calls for, but i think it has more flavor as oppossed to pure heat. it is available as a paste in small jars. you should be able to find it online if you don't have a market near you carrying this. be forewarned, i am a big fan of hot food, this is very potent stuff. also, if you are going to order your aji rocoto, go ahead and order some cancha as well. it is a corn cornel that is lightly toasted (so as not to actually pop it) and salted, then served as an accompaniment to ceviche. peru has many variety of corn that we do not have in the states, this is one. boil a sweet potato (camote in spanish) and serve your ceviche (prepared with aji rocoto) on a large lettuce leaf, with a couple slices of boiled sweet potato and some cancha on the side, and you will have a delicious quite healthy, traditional peruvian meal. enjoy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal fit_foodie reply 4 i am making this recipe for the second time.  my husband and i just think it is one of the tastiest ceviche dishes, even better than the restaurants we've visited.  i use tilapia and add shrimp that i have cooked ahead of time.  i also buy lime juice instead of squeezing fresh ( no bitter taste).  my peppers come from my garden that my hubby planted (mild).  i also serve with sweet potato and cancha on the side.  love it... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal slsmama reply 2 in  northern peru we  add some  finely  grated  fresh  ginger , and we salt the onion  let  stand  5min  then  rinse . and  we serve  with  cold  slices  of peeled  sweet potatoe also icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephenj reply 2 in peru, this ceviche goes accompanied by fried calamari, a boiled sweet potato and corn on the cob(cut into 2 pieces). then you would have a complete meal! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal latinashley reply 2 i love this recipe - have made it twice and add some chilli as i like it a little spicy icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal otakibelle reply 1 see 1 reply"
