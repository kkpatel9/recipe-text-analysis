Instructions
"directions ignore the directions on the bag that the rice came from and rinse the rice only 3-5 times. the water does not have to run clear. place rice to drain in a strainer. drain for one hourin the winter, 30 min in the summer. (sounds strange, but is true). while rice is draining, combine vinegar,sugar, salt and mirin together in a bowl and mix well. if using a kelp leaf,it should be about 2 in long wipe it lightly, cut small slits to make it look like a comb and add it to a pot along with the water. add rice to the pot. bring quickly to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. cover the pot and don't touch it until the end, no peeking. cook for 15 minutes before removing the pot from the heat but keep the lid closed. let rice rest for 10 min and then remove the cover. place in a glass dish to cool and lightly fan the rice while adding the vinegar mixture. mix rice gently, careful not to break it. sushi rice is best used at body temperature."
"directions prepare any sauces you will be making to use on your rolls ahead of time, so they will be ready. cut any vegetables you will be using in long thin strips about 1/4"".  (i like using european cucumbers with seeds removed, carrots, avocados, and green onions). if you are using tempura shrimp it takes 2 large shrimp per roll.  just place them end to end on your roll. if you're using tempura soft shelled crab, you use one crab per roll, laying it out so the claws will be sticking out each end of roll. if you are making rolls with raw fish on top (such as the rainbow roll), slice the fish pieces about 1/4"" thick, and they should be about 1"" wide pieces. if you are using tuna or salmon inside the rolls cut them into small chunks. to make a roll with the rice on the inside: place your mat on the surface you will be working on. place a piece of saran wrap on top of your mat. place a nori sheet on the saran wrap, shiny side down. dip your hands in water and then grab about 3/4-1 cup of cooked sushi rice, and place it on the nori sheet.  (dipping your hands in water first will stop the rice from sticking to your hands).  if you like less rice use 3/4 cup if you like a little more, use about 1 cup.  you don't want it so thick that it's difficult to roll. bring the rice up to just about 1"" from the far end of the nori sheet (the end without rice will help the roll to hold together). spread out the rice evenly with your hands, dipping them in the water if your hands start sticking. press the rice down with your hands, to make it stick to the nori sheet. place the ingredients your going to use in a horizontal line across the center of the rice. pour any sauce you may be using on top, such as spicy mayonnaise. if your making an inside out roll: where the rice is on the outside of the roll, put on your rice, then flip over so that the rice is on the saran wrap, and then place your ingredients in a horizontal line across the center of the rice. if your making a roll with fish on top of roll (ex:rainbow roll): place your fish pieces vertically over. lapping each other a little across the length of your roll. to roll the sushi: taking your fingers bring up the nori sheet, covering the ingredients. bring the mat up over the top of the ingredients, and start rolling up the sushi tightly to form a neatly packed cylinder (like a fat cigar). squeeze firmly to make sure the sushi roll is tightly packed (be careful not to squeeze too hard or you'll break the sushi roll). unroll the mat, and you have your sushi roll. cut each sushi roll into 1 1/2"" rounds using a sharp, damp knife (it's important that you re-moisten the knife after each cut).  (i usually cut in the middle of the roll, then in the middle of each of piece to make 4 pieces, then in the middle of those 4 to make 8 pieces altogether. plate your sushi. you may also try this way: when ready to roll, bring up the nori sheet and saran wrap over the ingredients, then roll pressing with your hands until it's rolled up like a cigar. take your mat and place it over your roll, and press the roll with your hands to tighten roll. when cutting rolls with fish on top: it is helpful to cut with the roll wrapped in the saran wrap.  just cut as instructed above with the saran wrap on top of the mat, then when done rolling take off the mat, cut through the saran wrap to cut your sushi into pieces, then pull off the saran wrap. plate your sushi. if using eel sauce: drizzle over the top of your sushi. serve along with wasabi, pickled ginger, soy sauce, or any other sauce you may like to use for dipping. note: if using lump crab mixed with spicy mayonnaise or masago on top of your sushi, spread on right before cutting, then cut as above."
"directions in a large mixing bowl, combine pork, cabbage, chives, ginger, garlic, chili oil, sesame oil, shaoxing cooking wine, soy sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper; stir until well blended. cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator for 1 hour. scoop meat mixture and place it in the center of a wonton wrapper. wet half of the edge with water and fold over. for crimping, make a small fold, pull slightly to the side and press down firmly; repeat until reach the other end. to make it look prettier, bend it to form a crescent shape. place gyoza on a plate lightly floured. keep filling until meat mixture is gone. in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add canola oil. when hot, place gyoza in a circle, flat side down, and cook for 2 ½ to 3 minutes or until nicely browned. pour in water, cover and steam for 3 minutes. remove from the heat and serve immediately with gyoza sauce. makes between 30 to 35 gyoza."

"directions before you start cooking, you will need to prepare the rice ahead of time. wash the brown rice 1-2 times then soak in water for 3 hours. i've used brown rice to make this rice ball but you can also use japanese white rice. if using white rice, you only need to soak it in water for 30 minutes before using. prepare the dried kelp or kombu by soaking it in water 15-20 minutes before using. prepare the rice seasonings by combining a tablespoon each of awamori, mirin and soy sauce plus a cup of water. if you can not find awamori which is an okinawan rice wine, you can use sake. use a strainer to drain the rice for about about 5 minutes. put it in a heavy-bottomed pot then pour the liquid mixture. turn on the heat using medium then put the pot with its lid on top. bring the liquid to a boil. once it boils, reduce the heat to low then simmer until most of the water evaporates. turn off the heat then keep the pot covered for another 10 minutes. never open the pot while cooking the rice. keep it covered especially after you've turned off the heat. frequently opening the pot will prolong the cooking process and the rice may not cook completely. remove the lid then mix the rice. let it cool until you can hold the rice at the palm of your hands. while waiting for the rice to cool, you can cook the shio-kombu filling. start by preparing the kombu seasoning by mixing 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 3 tablespoons of mirin, a tablespoon of sake and 2 tablespoons of sugar. mix the ingredients well until the sugar is dissolved. heat a pan using medium. use a strainer to drain the soaked kombu then put it in the pan. add the seasoning mixture then bring the liquid to a boil while stirring occasionally. once it boils, reduce the heat to low then cook until the liquid evaporates. once most of the liquid is gone, add a tablespoon each of soy sauce, mirin and sugar. stir well and cook until the liquid is reduced to half then remove from the heat source. let it cool before you start to make the rice ball. start by wetting your hands with water. it would be helpful if you prepare a bowl of water and a clean towel near you when making onigiri. the water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while the towel can be used to wipe your hands. spoon out about a handful of seasoned rice and put it at the top of the palm of your hands. put about a teaspoon of the shio kombu in the middle then press the rice so the filling will be covered with rice in the middle. you can form a ball-like shape onigiri with the shio kombu filling in the middle. use one palm of your hand to support the base of the onigiri. the other hand will help to shape the onigiri into a somewaht-traingular shape. press firmly but not too much. just enough so that the onigiri will hold its shape and will not break. do not press firmly as the rice might become hard when the rice ball cools down completely. cut out a rectangle from the nori sheet big enough so that it will reach the middle part of each side of the rice ball holding the base. press the nori sheet onto the rice ball then wait for it to stick with the rice then you can serve."
"directions start by seasoning the thinly sliced beef with a tablespoon each of sugar, soy sauce and sake. mix all the ingredients well then marinate for about 15 minutes. cut the potato and carrot into bite-sized pieces. for the shirataki, drain the liquid from its package then put on top of a strainer. pour a generous amount of hot water on top of it to help remove its slightly unpleasant smell. if the pieces are too long, you can cut it using a pair of scissors. remove the hard fiber part of the green beans found at its side if it has any. then, slice it diagonally into 2-3 pieces depending on its length. put the potato, carrot, onion and shirataki inside the microwave pressure cooker. add the beef with its marinade then mix the ingredients. cover the microwave pressure cooker then cook in the microwave for 8 minutes using 600w. after 8 minutes, wait for the pressure indicator to go down then open. add the green beans on top then put back the cover. let the remaining steam inside the microwave pressure cooker cook the green beans for about 2 minutes. open the microwave pressure cooker then mix all the ingredients carefully. put on a serving plate then serve as a side dish or as a main dish."
directions chop onion finely. heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and saute onion well and set aside. put egg and milk in a bowl and mix well. add breadcrumb in the bowl and mix lightly and set aside. put beef in another bowl and add cooked onion and breadcrumb mixture in it. season the beef mixture with salt and pepper. mix the meat well with hands well. make four meat balls and toss each ball from one hand to the other hand repeatedly. make four hamburger patties and indent the center of each one with a finger. heat oil in a pan and saute hamburgers over medium heat. turn over and saute the other side. add 1/4 cup of hot water in the pan and put lid and steam hamburgers for a few minutes. remove the lid and cook until the water is gone. transfer hamburgers into individual plates. add ketchup and worcestershire sauce in the pan after hamburgers are removed. mix quickly over low heat to make sauce. pour the sauce over hamburgers.

"directions toast sesame seeds until slightly brown, you will smell the scent of the sesame seeds when it’s ready. reserve small amount of the sesame seed for the garnish. place the rest on a plate and crush (you could do this in a processor as well), then place in a bowl. add water, soy, sugar into the bowl with the sesame seed. (if you are using the food processor then add these ingredients into the processor). set aside until spinach is ready. to cook the spinach: add a pinch of salt into a pot of boiling hot water.  mix then add spinach for one minute (only one minute or the recipe is ruined). pour the spinach and water into a colander and run cold tap water to cool down the spinach, this will stop it from cooking more. squish the spinach with your hands, until all the moister is out of the spinach (you are only left with a small hand full of spinach). cut spinach into strips (you could skip this part). place spinach onto serving bowls and drizzle the dressing onto the spinach, then add reserved sesame seed as garnish. enjoy chef flowers gomae - japanese style spinach salad. www dot recipezaar dot com."
"directions combine all ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days to develop taste and strain well after 1 day.  if you like more dashi flavor, then keep in refrigerator for 2 to 3 days and strain.  i normally like just one day in the refrigerator and strain.  the liquid ponzu sauce keeps in the refrigerator for 6 months (don't worry, you will use this up very, very quickly). the leftover katsuobushi and kombu after straining can be used to make furikake for later use."

"directions rinse and swirl sushi rice in a good quality pot that takes about 4 times its volume; drain in a strainer or sieve. do this three times and return the rice to the pot. add the cooking water. bring the rice and water to the boil on high heat. immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting, place the lid tightly on the pot, set your timer/cellphone/watch to 20 minutes and do not remove the lid for even a moment. in the meantime make the sushi-su (rice vinegar mix). mix the rice wine vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl and microwave for a minute or so. stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved. also use this time to prepare your other ingredients. when your timer goes off after 20 minutes turn the heat to zero, still do not remove the lid, and set your timer/cellphone/watch to another 20 minutes. after 20 minutes you may remove the lid! and turn the rice out into a large bowl - glass, ceramic, wood or plastic only. when it has cooled for a few minutes use a large blunt implement such as a flat-ended wooden spoon to make some gentle but deep incisions into the rice and pour half the sushi-su all over and into the cooling rice. gently turn the rice with your implement taking care not to make it stickier. make a few more incisions, and pour the rest of the vinegar. turn gently again as you allow the sushi rice to cool to body temperature before starting to make your sushi. bonus tip 1: while making sushi keep a bowl of clean slightly warm water next to you and frequently wet your hand as you spread the sushi rice onto the nori (with nori rough-side up) to prevent it sticking to your hand. bonus tip 2: make everyday sushi with ingredients you already have on hand. vegetarian maki rolls are fabulous and can include carrot (shavings or fine sticks), avocado (thinly sliced), cucumber (thinly sliced lengthwise, small mediterranean cucumbers are best with lower water content than english cucumbers), sesame seed (dry-toasted), spring onion (green onion or scallion), sweet red, orange or yellow pepper (pimento, finely sliced lengthwise), firm juicy-fleshed fruit such as strawberry and melon, and of course wasabi and japanese kewpie doll mayonnaise. bonus tip 3: only dip in kikkoman soya sauce. tens of thousands of sushi chefs around the world can't be wrong."
"directions let the rice in a bowl with water for 12 hours. then rinse the rice 3-5 times. cover the base of the pot's lid with alumium foil. drain the rice. uncovered put the water to boil. when the water is ready add the rice and cover, turn the heat to low. now on a separate bowl add the sugar, salt, vinegar and lemon juice; stir until a clear mixture is formed. remember to stir the rice every once in a while. when the rice has absorved all the water, add the mixture, and stir. after 5-6 minutes turn-off the heat, and let it sit for 10 minutes. let the rice cool down."
