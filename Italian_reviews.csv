"i didn't give this a rating because i didn't follow the recipe. i saw this dish made on america's test kitchen last week and was happy to find the recipe posted here. but when i went to make it, i realized that i didn't have any heavy cream, so tried to substitute half-and-half.  that didn't quite work out very well. the sauce was just slightly less than smooth and melted cheese stuck to the bottom of the serving bowl.<br/><br/>also, don't use more cooking water than called for. i used a quart and a half to boil 1/2 pound of pasta when the recipe specified 2 quarts for a whole pound. i understand the starch in the pasta water is an important part of this recipe, so that may have also had some bearing on the sauce consistency.<br/><br/>the flavor was great, and it couldn't have been easier to put together. the next time, i'll be sure to measure the water before adding the pasta. and i'll be sure to use heavy cream. no substitutions! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal laura2of7 reply 8 this is one of my all time favorite italian dishes. the recipe is so easy to make and comes together in no time at all@! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 6 see 1 reply quick, easy and delicious!!    i halved the recipe for dh and i, although i realise now i used all the cream - lol, well, it was lovely, i must say!   al dente pasta lightly coated with a creamy cheesy sauce, i gave it a generous grinding of black pepper and garnished with fresh basil,   it was delicious and i will definitely be preparing my pasta in this fashion again!  it would have been nice to have leftovers, but i finished it off.. it was just so nice!!!  next time, i'll have to make a full recipe! :d

"i like to add a paper thin slice of prosciutto right next to the beef. then provolone and mozzarella or whatever is on hand. then just bake with a drizzle of olive oil and red wine. 350Â° for 20 minutes. then slice for a great hor d'oeuvre. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal paulaannsonner reply 6 see 1 reply spaghetti sauce is just that, a sauce! gravy has a flour base. braciole is a wonderful addition to the sauce. interesting how many versions are made. i make mind with french chopped garlic, chopped parsley, sprinkle of bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. ask the butcher to put the beef through the tenderizer to keep it thin. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal carol p. reply 3 excellent flavors with this dish.  i used my homemade sauce, the cheese ozzed out into the sauce which made it even better.  have lots of meat left so will just add more sauce for another meal.  served with spaghetti, salad and hot italian bread. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adopt a greyhound reply 2 this was good and fork tender. i followed the recipe other then i used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. i cooked mine on the stove for 2.5 hours and it was so tender. it smelled awesome as it was cooking. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bmcnichol reply 2 i have made a similar resipe using all of the same ingrediance but i adder pine nuts. add as many as you like. they are very tasty and add a very good flavor to the sauce. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frankdpril reply 1"

"loved this! i used roma tomatoes and it turned out so yummy! this was the first time i have made risotto and it wasn't as difficult as i had imagined. the only thing i did wrong was not letting the liquid absorb fully before adding more so next time i will be a little more patient and it will be perfect. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal melissa k. reply 2 excellent risotto, really great flavor.   

'serves 8' must must mean as a side or entre, as a main i'd probably say serves 4.  very easy to increase the quantities, which i did. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal divzero reply 2 very rich!!  well worth the time and effort.  good on it's own or as a side dish.  i didn't have fresh basil ... i used 2 tbls of dried basil.  i'm sure with fresh basil it would be even better.  i'll definetly make it again.  thanks!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal canadiana cooker reply 2 excellent. i added a little chilli and a knob of butter and it was delicious. i aso added a squeeze of lemon at the end on the plate and it made it even tastier. thank you for recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal andrew reply 2 i made this with fresh tomatoes from the farmer's market and basil from the pot on my deck which is overflowing with the stuff. i must say the standing over the stove and stirring got a bit tedious after awhile. however, the result was a fine, fine flavorful risotto, definitely worth 5 stars. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal echo echo reply 2"
"i recognized this recipe right away as the one that used to be on the back of the muellers lasagna box back in the 70's.  the first time i made this i was 16 years old and had asked my mom if i could have a ""dinner party"".  i invited 8 boys, and one other girl. i followed this recipe as if i were a chemist- leveling every teaspoon, simmering for the exact time- it took me hours!  it was the first ""complicated"" recipe i had ever made.  i still make it today, but with one difference.  the time i use to cook the pasta has lessened, its too soggy if you follow the directions- cook the lasagna so its really toothy, the baking in the oven will do the rest to make it firm and tender but not mushy.  pasta cooks up differently than it did 40 years ago... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal handbright123 reply 3 this is the recipe my mother used for lasagna for years, i couldn't tell you how many.  i'd somehow lost it so i decided to google and try to find it because i remembered that she, like your mother, had gotten it from the back of a box of mueller's pasta.  this is such a delicious, easy recipe that everyone in my family loves.  thank you so much for posting it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal enfys reply 3 i've made a lot of lasagna in my life (so far) and this one is the best!  while it's fun to play around with the basic recipe, making this one exactly as stated has earned me compliments like ""the best lasagna i've ever had!""  i had the old recipe cut out from the the box for years and years, but lost it.  thank you for saving this and posting it here... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal handbright reply 3 a very tasty and easy recipe, i went for pasta sheets that didn't need pre cooked and the juices from the sauce are enough to cook them. this is definately a recipe i'll use again and was a hit at home. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bfo4007 reply 3 this is a terrific recipe! i'm not one for cooking a lot, but this is a simple recipe that even i feel comfortable making. 
 
i added more spices than the original recipe called for -- more parsley, salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and garlic powder. 

i also used the barilla lasagne noodles that you don't have to boil.  you just put them in and the moisture from the sauce softens them.  this worked out extremely well.

the lasagna was tasty, had good texture, and was a real hit!  (and it tasted even better served as leftovers.)

"in italy you can find these with prosciutto (very thin, dried ham), sausage, or even a variety of different veggies. i'd imagine just about anything you can put on a pizza or in a calzone, you can add to the inside of a arancini. i've had them as large as baseballs, they've had so much stuff in them (that was in sicily). the ones i make are usually larger than golf balls but smaller than baseballs. i've never used or needed a sauce but have had them with a little sauce added to the inside. they are one of my favorite italian foods! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tammy l. reply 8 of all the recipes i've made from this site, this has to be up there with top 5! i never knew arancini was so easy to make at home. i made it as directed and they were amazing. i can't wait to make again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 7 this recipe was outstanding, just love it. however i took advice from the previous reviewers and there are a few things to succesfully do this right. when the mixture was done i covered in plastic wrap and froze for 30 min, then did the balls and froze for 30 more minutes, they came out the fridge very firm and had absolutely no trouble when friying. as the balls were a little bit still sticky, because of the egg, decided not to coat with egg, then mixed the breadcrumbs and the flour, this to handle the arancinis less time possible before frying. i homemade a marinara sauce found also here at recipezaar to come with,  added some fresh salad with black olives and a wine bottle. the fact of writing this review makes my mouth waters, can't wait to do this recipe again thanks a lot for sharing icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef mate reply 7 delicious!!! i followed the advice on freezing them and did not coat with egg or flour. they were sticky enough that i was able to roll them in the bread crumbs with no issues. i also added a little bit of sautÃ©ed onions, peppers and garlic. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dunmar319 reply 2 delicious....one of my guests thought they were a little bland and needed pepping up a bit.  maybe a dipping sauce like your first reviewer suggested?<br/>edited...i've made these a few times now and they always come out well. i recently didn't have the ingredients to make a tomato based dipping sauce, so i used a jar of roasted pepper pesto which went with them very well.  i also swapped the parsley in the recipe for basil. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal patchwork dragon reply 2"
"this soup was a huge hit in our house!  it is a very hearty soup bursting with flavor.  the soup  is also very appealing to the eye with the red, orange, white and green colors from the vegetables and beans.  this soup is hearty enough to be a stew/chili as it is not loaded with broth.  i doubled the recipe using hot italian sausage and ground beef (i only had hot italian sausage which was too much heat for the entire family).  i used a couple of extra carrots and stalks of celery to beef up the vegetables.  i was unable to locate cannellini beans at my grocery store so i substituted navy beans which are also white.  i can't say enough about how great this soup tasted.  thank-you so much for sharing your recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal caryn reply 9 i just turned the burner off! this is soup is complete! this will sound silly; for years i've thought about making this type of soup but i thought it was way over my head. i have to tell you in all honesty it was the easiest thing in the world to make! oh yes, i did have a little sample: omg! this is the type of thing i can throw together in 15 minutes and tell everyone i spent all day! lol icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jamesjames14226 reply 5 so simple and delicious! the seasonings are perfect (although i did use only a small amount of the red pepper flakes). i used ditalini pasta, but would probably reduce the amount to 3/4 cup next time since it ended up soaking up a lot of the broth. but it was ok, i just added some more broth! this soup was tasty, warm, and comforting on a cold, rainy day. highly recommend! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal deliciousasitlooks reply 4 five stars i cannot express how good this is.. and it wasn't a huge pot of soup like i usually end up with.. pasta e fagioli.. food.com!! topped w/ freshly grated parmesan!!!!!! i used all fresh herbs and a larger pasta (all those goodies get inside the pasta) and served w/ warm baguette.,amazing!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kimcreasy reply 3 my husband said this is very hearty and very good, so i will add it to my collection.  i confess i ate three(!) bowls myself (without bread).  i have said before that it seems any soup made with italian sausage is good.  thank you, pannan. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal southern transplant reply 2"

"i am so thrilled with the taste of this biscotti! i got into a baking frenzy last year during christmas and decided to try for the first time ever making biscotti. i used this recipe and i was so happy with it! <br/><br/>i was reading other reviews and a few things i think might help people who have problems with sticky dough:<br/><br/>watch the humidity and warmth in your working space. a few times i cooked this recipe while i was cooking something else or washing dishes (once with the dish washer and once by hand). the dough turned out sticky and i had wondered what i did wrong since i did everything exactly the same and all the other times i made the dough it was perfect. after a few times of going through this i figured out that even the slightest temperature and humidity difference in the room had an effect. i kept aware of this and i haven't had a single batch of sticky dough since.<br/><br/>if the dough turns out sticky for you, the first thing to do is chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or so to make it workable. any time you're working with it and it starts getting sticky again, just put back in the refridgerator and chill it. after that, try opening a window and turning on a fan to cool and dry out your space and see if that helps. you can add more flour to the recipe as some folks did (which will cut down the taste a little and make your cookies more crunchy) but it shouldn't be necessary. first just try chilling the dough and cooling down and airing out/drying out your working space to see if it has an effect. good luck!<br/><br/>kittencal, this is a great recipe. thanks so much for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal eireanninion8 reply 6 kittencal, surely you don't need another 5-star review?? (lol!!) these are great: real genuine biscotti. i took your words to heart: to measure accurately. i did not have a 3/4 cup of unblanched almonds, and decided to make up the shortfall with pistachios, which worked just fine. i did not have any orange, so used lemon rind and some orange extract. like one of the reviewers, i also found the batter very sticky and quite hard to handle, but managed with more flour on the wooden board, when preparing the batter for the oven. i'd like to add the warning that this recipe is perhaps not for novice bakers. i used a sharp serrated knife for the cutting of the baked biscotti -- do not use an ordinary carving or paring knife, no matter how sharp! i'd also like to warn bakers with convection ovens that i found 170 deg c (about 338 deg f?) to be the right heat, and for the final baking i turned my oven to 160 deg c, which is 325 deg f. if i'd used 350/180 the biscotti could have burnt. (mind: this is just for fan ovens, which tend to bake very fast). a great biscotti, kittencal! i'm definitely going to bake another batch. and by the way, i also got 24 cookies -- you were spot on. thanks!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zurie reply 5 these are so tasty!  i had only one problem with the recipe... i followed the measurements precisely, but in the end needed approx. 1/2 cup more flour than the recipe called for.  without this my dough was so goopy it wouldn't even hold a shape (so making logs was impossible).  anyway, i used a standard all-purpose flour and that's how it turned out for me.  don't be afraid of more flour!  mine turned out great... not too dry or anything like that.  and so so tasty! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal colorado mel reply 4 yum i've made it twice now and have changed added ingredients, dried cherries, cranberries, lemon rind, coconut... whatever i have on hand. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cooper1224 reply 3 easy.  i used 1 cup of sugar.  the dough was sticky but i've been told that's how biscotti is supposed to be.  no problem forming logs.  the logs did stick to my cookie sheet a little.  maybe i should use parchment paper next time.  when cutting the logs, i found a slow sawing motion with a bread knife kept the pieces whole. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teachingchef reply 2"
"this is the definitive way to make gnocchi. i used to sit on my grandmothers lap while she taught me to roll the dough. those who had problems with this recipe must have done something wrong. the best way to insure a light gnocchi is to dry cook the potatoes, either bake or microwave. then allow to cool and either rice them or pass through a food mill. regular mashing techniques leave too many lumps, which make the dough difficult to roll. mix lightly and allow to sit for 30 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the moisture before rolling. this is a learned technique. keep trying, and don't fall for gimicks. this is the oldest and most recognized method. it makes a wonderful gnocchi! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal awilliams234 reply 12 see 1 reply my dad was from calabria, and we spent many a sunday morning sitting around the kitchen table making a big batch of gnocchi. dad would make the dough and us kids would roll the pillows. we all knew the process but no one knew the actual recipe. when dad passed the secret died with him until i found your recipe. one look at it and i knew i had found the recipe pop used! the only difference was the nutmeg, making these delicious little bundles of love brought back so many memories. thanks for sharing marli! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal joe c. reply 6 this was my first time making gnocchi, and they turned out great! they were like biting into light fluffy pilows. the 1 kg potato converted to 4 cups mashed (from food mill). the only thing i would change, is to add more salt. i would recommend doubling the recipe, so you can freeze them for a quick and easy dinner. thanks soo much for this recipe! i will never eat store-bought gnocchi again. they can't even compare. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bcgurl reply 4 very easy to make.  the gnocchi was very light as other reviews stated.  baked my potatoes so they would be drier and not add any extra moisture.  dought was sticky but easy to work with.  this will now be the recipe i use to make gnocchi from now on. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal happycooker2 reply 3 this was amazing !!! here are some commens, i believe it would serve only 3-4 instead of 6.  i followed up on the advice of s/o and cut them in smaller pieces. another thing to keep in mind for next time, is to add even more salt. except for that, as i said before, absolutly amazing. made it w/ a salsa rosa sauce. this is a keeper .... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jenny from the bloc reply 2"
"first off, kudos...this is the real deal! no cream! a couple things i've learned that have helped me with this recipe over the years. i always make the bacon/pancetta ahead of time and break/crumble. i also mix the egg, pepper, cheese, butter and bacon together and halve, putting 1/2 on bottom of bowl, adding pasta, then topping with other half. it's way easier to mix with a good distribution. otherwise you get clumps of cheese. i also add some good olive oil to the pasta before i add it to the cheese mix. love this recipe!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal randy l. reply 6 i made this for my husband who is super picky and he enjoyed it.  be prepared, it makes alot! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal denamac reply 5 great easy satisfying and super quick recipe.whole family loved it.making it again tonight and adding some sun-dried tomatoes as well just to try.will make this often. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal asil2809 reply 5 great, fast recipe! i added shallots, garlic, onion, jalapeÃ±os, and mushrooms while browning the bacon. at the end, just before i put mixture into drained pasta and sauce, i added frozen petite peas. perfecto! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lisamorse13 reply 4 this was my first time making pasta carbonara, and this recipe was really easy to follow and was so good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal esteban reply 3"

i used a 32 oz box of organic vegi stock, and added a touch of tomatoe paste after reading on of the reviews.  
it started with a 1/2 lb fillet of sole i had left over - i had to pop to the fish market to get 1/4 lb shrimp, 1/2 lb bay shrimp and 1/2 lb fresh clams.  it turned out wonderfully - i was a little apprehensive about leaving a lid on the onions and tomatoes (oh and i added a few chopped up mushrooms here) for 45 mins - but it worked and i only peeked once!

"excellent!  i lost my origional recipe.  i believe this is the exactly the same.  i would not try recipes calling for fewer lemons and shorter processing time.  hardest part is the waiting, but well worth it.  second hardest part is making sure no white remains on the peel, also worth the time.  product is amazingly smooth and flavorful.  when aging is complete i keep it in the freezer. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal roger reply 10 this is my second review.  i am now making 7 gallon batches 2 to 3 times a year.  my friend buys the vodka and the sugar.  i supply the labor. french oak chips, and dried lemon peels.  peeling that many lemons has become too much labor.

let me tell you what i have learned.  do not waste your money on high quality vodka.  se buy 1.75 liter bottles for $9 or less.  everclear is not worth the money either.  i have substituted honey for sugar and it does not make a significant improvement.  french oak chips can be purchased at a homebrew store and add both color and taste.

"bland.  i used this recipe versus others i found because the steps were outlined simply, which i really like because these are super difficult to make and gave me a bit of confidence.  the steps did work well however, i recommend moving step 27 to number 1 to give the ricotta sufficient time to drain.<br/><br/>the flavor was truly disapointing.  this recipe needs butter and because it only calls for shortening the pastry tasted just like bland pie dough.  rolling out the disks with a rolling pin sort of worked: i got ridges, but the flaky layers did not pop up. the filling also needs work; some more sugar for sure because every sfogliatelle i have ever tasted has been sweeter than this and had more fruity flavor, so i would probablly add a bit more candied fruit too and a dash of cinnamon. <br/><br/>again, the process is laid out nicely here, but i would follow the same steps using the ingredients from a different recipe.  a tip:  i used my pasta maker to roll out the dough.  instead of creating one large sheet of dough i rolled out 4 long strips and stacked those. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ninderella38_3947956 reply yum yum yum! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cooking_with_gass reply i haven't tried the recipe listed, but these are my all time favorite and i'm sooo excited that you have added this recipe.  i'll take this over a zepole any day (the rest of the family thinks i'm odd lol).

"the hardest part of this recipe is waiting for it to chill in the fridge before eating! it's such a great classic tiramisu. i'll definitely be making it again soon! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 4 i wanted a recipe that did not include raw eggs, so i tried this. i was great! i used only marsala, no brandy. otherwise i followed the recipe to the letter except for the lady fingers. i used the soft kind of lady fingers from the bakery rather than the hard cookies called for in the recipe, but it turned out fine. i skipped the refrigeration of the marscapone/zablagione mixture because i was afraid that the chilling would make it too stiff to spread on the soft cookies. i'm glad i did that, because it would have totally destroyed the layering and just mixed the cookies in with the cream stuff. so, if you don't want to wait, just skip that 1 hour refrigeration step - it will work out just fine. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cook in northwest reply 3 very nice tiramisu. this was my first time trying one at home. i had no idea there was marsala in the custard but it was perfect in there. the sabayon came out beautifully and i liked the fact the eggs were cooked as opposed to so many recipes that use them raw. i didn't have any brandy (or alcohol besides marsala) so i upped the coffee appropriately and used a shot of rum extract. may not have been the best substitution but i really liked that there was not an over-powering alcohol taste. i gave this a 4 because there really wasn't enough custard for me. i think there should be a fairly thick layer. the ladyfingers were just moist but not a gooey soggy mess. i did the best i could with the custard made and then added a generous layer of whipped cream on top. taste was perfect, even my non-tiramisu eating family members gobbled this one up. technique was great too. i would just double the custard, or half the ladyfingers and put it in a smaller pan. personal preference. great recipe. thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal aqueen reply 2 wow! what a great recipe! tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts. i don't like dry tiramisu. this one was really moist. i loved how all the flavors came together. i made a few changes: added 100 % cocoa powder, i used marsala for the zabaglione, but instead of the marsala used in the coffee mixtures, i used kahlÃºa 1/2 cup, and covered final layer with chopped good quality dark chocolate. i also dipped the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture, instead of spooning it. will make this over and over.. for special ocasons. my concience will not allow me to do it too often! strongly recommend it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal monietel reply 1 make this recipe! double batch! made  double batch of the zabaglione cream and am i glad it did! this is a fabulous recipe! i used armanac and a slash of frangelico in the wicked strong espresso we pressed (italian roast beans) - brushed it onto the lady fingers rather than dipping. had enough custard leftover to do a small single layer pan (4 x 6) - which we are nibbling on tonight after making yesterday. omg so good! made a part of my post periodontal mooshy foods recovery program (surgey in 2 days). this will do very nicely. additionally, the 9 x 13 pan means there will be plenty for dh and friends who will come by later in the week. make this recipe - it is glorious in balance of taste and texture. ty for posting this one grace lynn. it is a real keeper. ftr - brushing the lady finger 2 or 3 times with a soft brush dipped in espresso is plenty - i found 4 swipes ended up making them a bit too soft the next day (but they taste awesome in their espresso boozy mooshiness!) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal busters friend reply 1"

"this recipe is awesome.  i found it this past weekend and saved it for a future attempt at making ravioli.  however, i was ambitious today and made the dough to use as fresh pasta.  i pulsed the salt and flour together in my food processor, then added the eggs and water.  i processed only a short time, until the mixture formed into a ball, and  only had to knead a few minutes.  <br/><br/>to make the noodles, i worked with 1/4 of the dough at a time, rolling as thin as possible, squared off with a small pizza cutter, and cut the noodles as uniform as i could.<br/><br/>thanks for such an easy, delicious pasta dough recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chicook reply 10 these ravioli turned out great! i used the ricotta and ham filling and pressed the edges down with a fork. the reviewer below said the water amount was way too much, but i actually had to add more water to get the dough to come together. next time i will add more to get the dough thinner as my ravioli were a bit thick. i also used whole wheat flour and it worked well. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cteberry reply 6 i just made this last night, and it was fantastic!  i used a slight variation of filling ingredients based on what i had on hand, so i thought i would share it for others to try.  i boiled a chicken breast and when it was cool shredded it into small pieces.  then i put the shredded chicken in a bowl with one egg, a couple tablespoons of parmesean, a handful of mozzerella, and some italian seasoning.  it turned out really good with a simple tomato sauce to finish the raviolis off, and even my picky 3-year-old loved them! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal amzys9599 reply 6 if i could give this dough recipe 100 stars i would! i've made it very often since first trying it.
i use a pasta machine and the best tip i came across was to very lightly dust the dough with cornflour before passing it thru the machine. it won't stick at all.
this tip revolutionised pasta making for me as did this fantastic recipe.
just one note: depending on the egg size (we have our own hens so the eggs i use aren't sized) i sometimes have to add a little water/flour.

"very tasty! i used bucatini pasta which is like a cross between spaghetti and macaroni. i did not add the olive oil as the fat from my bacon took care of the mushrooms. i also drained off all the excess bacon drippings before adding the cream. i used half and half to lighten it further and did not cook it 15 minutes, but added the cream and onions along with the parsley then tossed in the cooked pasta which i made sure i did not rinse, so the starches on it effectively helped the sauce cling to the pasta in about 1-2 minutes. as you can see in my photo, it did not puddle, and doesn't need a thickener either. i garnished with parm and red pepper as is my habit with most pasta (and the reason i stirred in the parsley, because i didn't want all that covering up too much food in my photo.) it's personal preference really. i might try this one with peas sometime, but probably will use pancetta in that case as it's what i am used to. thanks for sharing. delicious lunch! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal palatablepastime reply 1 i can't believe that a dish so creamy, delicious, and satisfying is this easy to make! a slight change i made was the addition of a little salt and pepper (about 1/4 teaspoon each). i also skipped the olive oil and used bucatini pasta like another reviewer suggested. the sauce will thicken up nicely if simmered long enough. i love the scallions, they add a light onion flavor that doesn't overpower the dish, and goes well with the bacon. i served this with some grated parmesan cheese on top for a little extra decadence. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal deliciousasitlooks reply the hubby and i both loved this dish...the only thing i added was salt and pepper...such an easy dish to make...we loved the creamy sauce and the mushrooms added a nice substance...it was almost like having meat...we enjoyed the nice flavor of bacon...made for...for your consideration...tag game... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teresas reply the dh out of the blue asked for a tortellini recipe and i remembered justjans review and like jan had so much trouble getting the veal tortelllini but in the serving size i wanted - in the end i settled for 2 x 375g packs (recommend 2 serves per pack) and used about 700 ml of cream to keep it moist. did take a tip from a cook in a takeaway/lunchbar and put the cooked tortellini into the cream/mushroom mix and heated through for about 10 minutes (as dh was running late from 12 hour day shifts and the 10 minutes turned to 20). i also added peas and corn kernels with cooking the pasta. all all in all and meal enjoyed by all thank you karen elizabeth, made as a recipenap for aussie recipe swap #25 february 2009.  update have made this several times now but now only use 1 375gram packet for 4 of us and add the extra vegies and serve with garlic bread and find that is adequate for us especially as the dm and i only have small serves. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal i'mpat reply needs a lot of modification.  the suggested chorizo idea sounds horrible,<br/><br/>much better recipe:<br/>cook 4 ounces chopped pancetta in 1 tbl olive oil or butter till crisp.   add 2 cloves chopped garlic and 1 sliced leek, saute 2 min.  add 10 ounces sliced portabello mushrooms, saute an addl 8 min till mushrooms are tender not mushy.  add 3 tbl dry white wine, 1/2 pint cream, 1 tsp thyme; bring to boil and reduce heat, simmer 10 minutes.  add a bit of milk if it gets too thick.  add 1/2 c grated parmigiano reggiano or grana padano cheese, stir to melt.  add al dente tortellini or other pasta; stir to coat.  plate dish with chopped italian parsley and additional grated cheese. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ktag4875 reply see 3 replies"
"the good news: these are delicious and easy to make. the cookies remind me very much of a mexican version of snickerdoodles especially with the ""crackling"" effect on top. the bad news: the directions are not clear or concise. by stirring all ingredients together at once just doesn't work.  my changes: shortening, egg and sugar were blended with a mixer. flour and leavening, etc. were sifted then added to the wet ingredients. i found it easier to roll the cookies in the sugar/cinnamon mix before baking. also, i substituted raw sugar and unrefined cane sugar for granulated to roll the cookies in. lastly,  and possible most importantly, how long to bake the cookies?  that is very important information which was not indicated. i ended up baking the cookies for a total of 10 minutes and that seemed to be the perfect amount of time with my range.  i don't like to give star ratings below 4,  a comment will suffice and i'll leave it at that. reviewed for zwt 2009. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookgirl reply 3 easy, delicious and fragrant. great for family cooking. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal alenafoodphoto reply is too much of something a bad thing? then i am oh, so bad! made for zwt5 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gailanng reply these are good cookies, not to sweet, just right. i'm sure they would go really well with coffee as a mid morning snack or for an afternoon tea. i did change the recipe slightly. i added about 2 1/2 cups of flour, and i didn't have cream of tartar so i left that out. i also put my oven at 375f because with my oven it was too hot at 400. thank you for sharing your mom's cookie recipe! made for zwt5. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal leahs kitchen reply i ate 3 of these for my birthday dinner with a cup of coffee and couldn't be happier. they are like an anise flavored snicker doodle. i was a little worried when i first started mixing the dough because it seemed a bit crumbly but everything started coming together to make a ball. make sure to spread them out on the cookie sheet because they do spread. this would be a great recipe to get your kids to help you with because it was fun rolling them into balls. serve them with coffee and hot chocolate for the kids and everyone will be happy! viva las reynas! made for zwt 5. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephanie y. reply"
"fantastic recipe.  use this recipe as a company dinner when you want to wow your guests.  i followed recipe exactly using half & half for the cream, and baby portobella mushrooms.  i did not clarify the butter...was in a hurry.  because my chicken was rather thick, i baked it in a covered casserole for 20 mins., removed the foil, and baked an additional 10 mins.  perfect!!!i think this recipe would be excellent using deli sliced ham instead of the expensive (and salty) prosciutto.  thanks judy for sharing this wonderful dinner recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal boxowine reply 5 we had this last night for dinner.

"a very good and authentic bolognese.  it is amazing how many bolognese recipes are out there without the milk.  that is not bolognese....that is meat sauce.  this has the milk and it makes such a difference!   i added a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity of the wine and the tomato.  i also added a 14oz can of petite diced tomatoes, for a little chunkiness.  the pancetta makes the dish. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lizp5885 reply 2 this was a nice bolognese sauce, albeit a little labor intensive. i had to sub bacon for pancetta as mine had expired and this seemed to work fine.  went nice over penne.  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dr. jenny reply 1 this is a great recipe.  we also believe that bolognese needs dairy and are glad that we included this.  the one addition we made was to add about a half cup of parmesan during the last 30 minutes of simmering.  based upon the other reviews, we increased the pancetta and used a little bit of extra basil from the garden.  i'd love to tell you how this held up in the freezer, but it doesn't look like it'll make it there.  thanks, chia. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal akikobay reply 1 followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous...i did let it simmer on the stove for 4 hours slowly and it was perfect... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cindytc reply 1 very, very good! thick and hearty, full of fabulous distinctive flavors. because i have a big family i added more beef and pork. i did not use veal at all, subbing the beef and pork instead. had to add more tomatoes due to the extra meat but otherwise followed the recipe as written. i might reduce the wine to 1/2 cup next time or perhaps choose a different brand. it seemed a bit overpowering to me and my family. will compensate, of course, with other liquid. fabulous!!! thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jennifer nickels reply 1"
"love this recipe - very easy to make and tastes great!  dimpi mentioned that the garlic burns in the oven, so in order to avoid that, i sliced the garlic cloves into the olive oil and heated it for a few minutes, then drizzled the dough with the oil before baking - no burned garlic, but we still got the garlicky flavour.  i'll certainly be making this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flor_enojada reply 3 loved this easy bread recipe! i like that this is relatively fast compared to other bread recipes, i took the advice of some others and used parchment paper as well, it turned out great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply 2 fabulous!!! i have made this twice and it was excellent both times. served with chicken ceasar salad and then another time at a girls lunch with chicken salad. thank you for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal arctic mama reply 2 delicious! i made this once years ago and never got a chance to review it. i finally made it again with dinner tonight and boy was it amazing! i put on lots of garlic for the last 15 minutes of cooking so it wouldn't burn. so good. thank you for a great recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal maggi lynn reply 2"
"i made this last night with very few modifications. it was delicious. the only mods i made were to leave out the potatoes due to avoiding starches. i used the fish i had which was mahi mahi and red snapper. i added some fennel seed because i love fennel with fish and the fennel bulb didn't give as much fennel flavor as i wanted. i also added a whole roasted red bell pepper, just because it sounded good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal smoky okie reply 3 the soup fit my current low cal, low carb diet perfectly and i knew by looking at the ingredients that this recipe had to be a winner and it was.  what a great flavored soup!  i used knorr shrimp bouillon instead of the shrimp stock and i used a jar of marinara sauce as a substitute for one of the cans of tomatoes.  i also added more garlic and a few dashes of hot sauce.  yummm.....the flavors simply danced in my mouth! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal beckas reply 3 i fixed this for our dinner the other night and all i can say is wow!!  i cut the recipe in half used 3/4 of a can of diced tomatoes (28 oz. italian), about 1 1/2 cups of crushed tomatoes and used a piece of sea bass, one tilapia fillet, some shrimp and almost 1/2 a package of trader joe's seafood mix (put shrimp and the seafood mix in towards the end till cooked).  i did add a little (about 1/4 tsp.) of fennel seed along with the other spices and followed the rest of the recipe.  i did use kale, which we loved because it retains some of its texture and doesn't get mushy.  thank you for another wonderful recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mama smurf reply 2 yummo! great mix of flavors and so healthy.. a keeper icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ksee9128 reply 1 this is very good.  my son thought their were too many veggies in it.  i think the fennel was a bit much for him.  i think i would have liked it better with three 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of 2 28 oz cans.  i loved using the broth made from the shrimp shells.   and  i think the white wine is a good choice.  a lot of the recipes call for red wine and i think that would be way too overpowering.  i used haddock as the fish and it was very nice.   i think jumbo shrimp would be the best choice.  i used large and they shrunk quite a bit. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal drivethrudodger reply 1"

"7-10 stars!!!

my only caveat is that i didn't use all the broth. i was shy about a cup, thinking i didn't want to over cook. better over than under, i say.

delicious delicious delicious. smells amazing while cooking (after the wine, i used a champagne/sparkling wine). the chives and wine and butter are a winning combination.

i used an oninon in place of 2 shallots. and canned mushrooms for half the mushrooms (not cooking them but adding them to the others) and a bit more parmesan cheese and slightly more chives.

don't forget the addition of salt and pepper, espically the pepper.

one of my favorite recipes on the zaar! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal food snob in israel reply 6 wonderful recipe for risotto! this is exactly like my go-to recipe, but i use half the ingredients because there are only 2 of us at home, and it makes enough for 2 generous dinner portions, with some left over for a lunch portion the next day. i like to cook the mushrooms in a little butter and oil until browned, and set them aside to add in at the end of cooking. it helps button mushrooms keep a nice texture and not get mushy. if you don't like mushrooms, you can substitute any vegetable you like. sauteed sliced asparagus or steamed peas are an excellent addition, or if you like seafood you can use cooked small peeled shrimp or little bay scallops, sauteed first. stir any additions in at the end to avoid overcooking. this method is exactly right for any flavor of risotto, or just make it plain and it's great. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cathyfood reply 4 i made this for dinner, to go with grilled pork chops and asparagus. it was a huge hit. the long cook time is most definitely worth the effort.  my dh has asked me to make it a regular part of my menu rotation. thanks for an excellent recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamabear451 reply 2 this was the first time i ever made risotto, and it truly came out restaurant-quality fantastic. followed the recipe exactly, but browned some cubed prosciutto and added it at the very end with the shrooms - made a really amazing main dish. my more advanced-palate friend and my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend both loved it!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal djbarnez reply 2 excellent recipe.  i used some extra parmesan cheese (because i like it alot).  also, a good substitution is some goat-cheese in favor of the butter. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef remy 186273 reply 2"

"thank you, rita!  apologizing for not rating your recipe for several years.  every time i see eggplant in the market, i do a mental calculation of how many bags of it i have in my freezer.  you see, i use it for a 'cooking"" sauce for fish filets and chicken breasts. it freezes well. i've also used it with pasta as a salad.  even when on a diet, i figured how to make this without olive oil and the results are nearly the same when baked on mild fish or chicken.  really jazzes up a dish.  many ears ago i found the canned commercial variety which is really more like an appetizer spread and  loved it.  this recipe is much looser than the canned variety and thus more versatle.  love you for posting this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal smalltowngirl reply 2 oh sooo delicious! i used 1/4 cup of basil (it's coming outta my ears) & doubled the capers but left out the salt & sugar (my balsamic vinegar is very thick & syrupy). i did also add a twist or two of coarsely ground black pepper. this stuff is great! i am packing up a 1/2 pint to include in a summer garden bounty package for a friend - i know she;ll love it. thank you rita, this one is a keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal busters friend reply i am not sure why it has taken me so long to review this recipe.  it is one that i make once to twice a year and can so that i have some when ever i want.  this stuff is deeelicious!  i like to serve it room temp on toasted baguette slices.  though it is just as good warm as a side dish or mixed into pasta.  i do think it gets better and more complex with time.  i usually do not use the sun dried tomatoes.  i have a garden and use the eggplant and tomatoes from there.  you won't miss the exclusion if you don't have any in your pantry!  thanks rita for a family favorite! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal macchef reply friend gave me some eggplant.  i really want to love the stuff, so i keep trying recipes.  this one is a winner.  i had it one day for lunch with some leftover pasta.  also shared with some friends on crackers.  one of them said it would be very good as a pizza topping.  hmmmm - i will have to try that & get back to you.  bottom line, i love this recipe.  now i will have a difficult time using eggplant for anything else.  and after i picked out a bunch of other recipes to try...  thank you very much for sharing this. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal feej3940 reply this is very, very good! tried some other caponata recipes too, loved the stuff, but this is just something else! how can something so healthy be so good? had it with garlic bread, perfect appetizer. thank you for another favorite! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rosslare reply"

"yes, this is a yummy recipe! i could not find veal, and used lamb shanks. i also used more veggies, and added finely chopped garlic when the dish was finished, so the flavour would not cook away. i did not simmer it on the stove (could not stay and watch it) but put it in a 140 deg c convection oven. (about 275 deg f). during the process on the stove i added a few swirls of honey, which counteracts the slight acidity of the tomato and adds flavour. one criticism: the ingredients as written are silly! the chef was sooo careful with his calculations for 2 people, that he went over the top. the recipe would appeal to more people if the tiiiny extra amounts he added (like 2 1/4 t olive oil) were left out. one caveat: watch the stew in the oven, as it will need more water or stock as it simmers. it must be covered, and i find it's very nice to have a pot with a glass lid so i can see right through. a delicious, comforting dish, heartily recommended -- just use your own judgment with those pernickety ingredient measures!! thanks for a basically great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zurie reply this is very similar to my friend's recipe, he's a chef.  i first had it at his restaurant and it was amazing.  this recipe is almost an exact match and ohhh sooo good, thanks for sharing!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookin in nj reply"

"this is an excellent recipe for muffuletta bread.  in fact, i have a double recipe in my oven right now...really!---

however, this recipe is taken practically word for word from a great cookbook called, ""cajun-creole cooking"" by terry thompson.  i believe it was first published in 1986.  i don't know if, ""linda"" took this recipe from the book or from someone else who took it from the book but i do believe in giving proper credit to the original author.---

as i said, the recipe is very good. i use rapid rise yeast and i make mine in my kitchen aid mixer.  i first combine the water, yeast and sugar in a separate bowl.  in the mixer work bowl i combine the flour, salt and shortening, (this time i used lard) and mix it with the mixer paddle until the fat is cut in thoroughly.  i then add the water/yeast and a bring it together with the paddle.  i then switch to the dough hook.  sometimes i have to add a few more tablespoons of water to keep it moist.  it should just barely pull away from the side of the bowl while it kneads.  i let it knead on about speed 3 for 10 minutes.  i remove the dough and briefly knead it by hand before shaping it into a smooth round ball.  i put the ball into a greased large metal bowl and cover with plastic wrap to double in bulk.  another change/recommendation i would make is that when you punch down the dough and spread it out into a round loaf you make it smaller than 10"", maybe more like 9"".  as it rises it will also spread out to about 10"".  i gave this recipe 5 stars but i gave those stars to terry thompson instead of linda because terry is the original.  time to take the bread out of the oven.   yum!  it came out perfect, as usual!--

"these were great.  i had a bit of trouble cooking the cookies.  i may have made them a bit thick,  i turned out with 16 cookies and had to increase the cooking time to about 12 minutes at 350 for the cookies to set.  also i only have one sheet pan so i chilled the left over dough before making the second batch and found that made it much easier to roll out the dough without it sticking to my board while cutting out the cookies.  i used frangelico on the cookies and chopped almonds for the ice cream rolling.  oh, yeah, i didn't have an egg on hand, so i used recipe #19402 which worked really well, though now that i think about it may, be the reason i had trouble getting the cookies to set up. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mc baker reply 1 this was great. the amaretto gave the cookie almost a marzipan flavour. i love chocolate and almonds so i melted some semi-sweet chocolate and spread it on the cookie. i used finely chopped almonds and chocolate and candied sprinkles to roll the semifreddo in. delicious. will make this again thanks. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal marlitt reply i found the cookie dough to be fairly easily to work with, but would caution against over working the dough.  i rolled it out fairly thin and ended up with 21 cookies using a biscuit cutter.  i did skip the amaretto step.  after the cookies cooled, i used purchashed vanilla bean gelato & sliced almonds to make 6 sandwiches.  they were very good and i am happy i made several for the freezer.  the rest of the cookies will be enjoyed plain.  made for zwt 4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal susie d reply zwt4 italian dessert challenge: made the cookies (with amaretto) last night and assembled them this morning!! tried one for breakfast before work as a splurge!! nice treat! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mom2rose reply i cant believe i finally made an italian frozen dessert!  this was so easy, i completed the dish while waiting for laundry to dry.   used my mexican vanilla and borrowed puppitypup's  suggestion and used my pastry brush to add the amaretto to the cookies.  used pistachios to better go with the vanilla base i was using.  after this, will not be at all timid about italian frozen desserts.  thnx mamma mia for posting.  made for zwt4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal darkhunter reply"

"my family really enjoyed this recipe.  i made them for my freezer, doing it two different ways.  the first batch i formed into patties, put in my baking dish with the sauce on top and froze it pan and all.  i didn't want to tie up my other dish for the second batch, so this one i made the patties, flash froze, then put in the freezer with no sauce.  at serving time, we added the sauce and cheese on top.  both worked out well and there was very little leftovers. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stacyw reply i made this two different ways: one as a 'regular dinner' one for a freezer meal.  the only thing i changed was using spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce (the can i thought i had was no where to be found) and used 1/2 the amout of mozzarella cheese.

the first time through i followed the directions for 4 servings.  even cutting the cheese in 1/2, it was way too much food.  hubby and i shared one patty and were full (had veggies, no pasta).  flavor wise, it was kind of bland and i didn't know if i'd do it again.

the batch i froze was made into 6 patties, also with 1/2 the cheese.  i browned the patties and placed in a foil pan.  i used 1/4 cup spagetti sauce on top of each patty and distributed the cheese across the top of all.  i covered the pan with foil and slid (with directions for baking) into a large ziploc bag.  last night i pulled it out of the freezer until time to cook.  it probably could have used a few extra minutes in the oven and next time i'll cook the meat patties longer until closer to done.  the flavor was much better after freezing (maybe from the sauce being in contact longer) but i'll still add a sprinkle of garlic or onion powder and italian seasoning next time as we like a stronger flavor.  

hubby gave it a thumbs up, my youngest stepdaughter did too (and she usually doesn't like ground beef not in meatloaf!).  as a 'freeze ahead' it would make an easy weeknight dinner.  i warmed up some of the leftovers the first time i made it and it made a nice lunch. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gabby lsw reply this made a nice weekday dinner that my family enjoyed.  i used a little less cheese and non-stick cooking spray instead of oil.  it worked very well. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chris from kansas reply this was a easy quick meal to throw together with some buttered noodles.  i did use some of my sister's sauce rather that tomato sauce, as well as adding some minced garlic, but other than those changes i stayed with what you had.  nice weeknight meal.  thanks! :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal *ozman* reply sorry...we just didn't care for this very much. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal charmie777 reply"
