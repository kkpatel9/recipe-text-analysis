"without doubt the best, most detailed sushi rice technique i've ever heard of.  perfect results every time and the flavour is something else entirely!<br/><br/>outstanding effort.  thanks so much for sharing!<br/><br/>cameron.<br/>edinburgh, scotland, uk. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal color_me_cam reply 6 made sushi for the first time,thank you for giving such detailed directions.i followed the recipe exactly and the rice was wonderful! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal melrenee72 reply 3 after reading the reviews i incorporated some of the sugggestion & the rice turned out perfect. the sugar didn't dissolve in the liquid so i zapped it in the microwave & solved that problem. i took the suggestion of cooling the rice in a 9x13 pyrex which made it easy to drizzle the liquid & blend. i used the exact ratio of rice/water; rinsed the rice only 3 times; & cooked as directed. please use google to see mirin vs rice vinegar & get yourself a bottle of mirin @ any asian food mart....you won't be sorry. if you're going to the trouble of making sushi rolls why not do it right? and the person who thought this way too salty....i can't imagine why....it's only 1/4 tsp per cup....unless they measured wrong. bon appetite! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal islandgryl reply 2 see 1 reply unless you like very salty al-dente rice, this tastes awful. i washed off the finished product added a couple of cups of water and am trying to fix it now.
i should have been suspicious with the low cook time and the amount of salt (2 tsp for 2 c rice).
don't get all the good reviews but maybe lack of sushi experience? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rich1000 reply 2 see 2 replies i've actually been making this sushi rice for a while now. it always comes out perfect. the directions are easy to follow and if you follow it to a t, you'll have the best sushi rice ever! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1"
"a great comprehensive guide to making sushi at home. i used cooked shrimp with cucumber and carrots. it was so easy to follow! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 yeah, like this needs yet another five-star rave...but...wowwweee!  i made a huge platter (about 100 pieces!) of several different rolls, to take as my appetizer to our supper club, and the fifteen people there fell on it like starving wolves.  i used ""minado's perfect sushi rice"" (and it was perfect) and l's busy kitchen's spicy sauce for dipping, and it was all wonderful.  no leftovers!  my husband insisted on doing the rolling, though, after i assembled all the fillings.  he says the best sushi chefs are men! (hey, i was glad of the help...he's not much of a kitchen guy otherwise!) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal la dilettante reply i have always been intimidated to make sushi, but after running across these simple to follow directions i ventured to the store to get my ingredients to make some.  thank you so much for this tutorial linda. you have made a sushi maker out of me! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kissthecook reply you have made me look so good.  my family thinks i am the best for being able to make sushi at home.   we all love it and this makes it so much more affordable.  i have tried different combos and we loved them all.  i will continue to make this at home, thanks to your instructions and helping me through this. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephanie s. reply you are the queen of my world tonight, linda.  i must admit i have wanted to do this forever, but it was intimidating, so i just didn't try.  amazing and simple!!! we made all ""cooked fish"" versions for the first try, but next time we will go ahead with raw.  made crab, shrimp and smoked salmon with assorted veg and some with a little cream cheese.  all wonderful.  we even mastered the ""inside out"" version with the rice on the outside.  super good and everyone stuffed themselves.  thanks and thanks again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal messy44 reply"
these tasted just like the real deal and i was pretty impressed with myself for making them at home. the flavor with the chili oil was great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1
"had some potstickers in the freezer and so i made this sauce to go alongside with them and it was perfect! great flavor combination and the best part was that the ingredients were easy to find! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 doubled quantity and froze left-over... added garlic also... great flavor!!! used this with homemade egg rolls similar to recipe# 134053 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ptsd709 reply 2 outstanding recipe! this one will definitely be sticking around our house. it was better than the sauce from the restaurant and there was some talk around the table about drinking it. lol icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal alisa r. reply 2 see 1 reply i made this the day before and i thought for sure the ginger would be too strong, but it wasn't.  i doubled it and it is a great sauce.  i used it with #98345 potstickers.  keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal debberd2 reply 2 this is some good ""stuff""!!  i loved the flavors of ginger and soy...then kicked up a notch by the red pepper.  the only substitution i made was splenda for the sugar, and i only used 2 tsps instead of 2 1/2 tsps.  i did double the recipe, so i could try it out on asparagus.  it was so good that i also used it on okra.  don't laugh....that was fantastic too!  thanks, bev for sharing this keeper. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal miss annie reply 2"
"i've always wanted to try making chicken katsu at home. this was incredible! the sauce really makes it and it was delicious with rice and cabbage. so good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 4 simple, easy, delicious.   i just love cooking with panko, and you are right about the tanginess of the sauce.   the chicken breasts didn't take very long to cook - more like 3 minutes a side, but then they may have been smaller than you used.    thanks for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jangomango reply 2 delicious and, btw, is this comment font big enough? would it be easier to read if i wrote in capitals?  delicious! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gailanng reply 1 new twist on an old thing- chicken fried steak or schnitzel. the sauce is good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tom w. reply i have been making chicken or beef tonkatsu for years. i serve it with tuna nigiri sashimi over rice, miso soup, and serve with green tea and pickle salad. a good recipe for beginners! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephengoldberg11 reply"
"delicious.  made per recipe except made it vegan, so subbed margarine, left out chicken and put in edamame.  kids inhaled this.  will definitely do this again.  thanks for a great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal joop reply 1 see 1 reply very tasty recipe but way too spicy for myself and my son. my husband liked the spice, though. i liked how easy it was to put together. i will make it again either with milder curry powder or with less. made for zwt6 zingo for team ssassy. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sarahubasics reply 1 we thoroughly enjoyed this dish! my changes were using an extra garlic clove, ketchup as suggested, only 1 tbls of curry - still plenty spicy, and 2/3 of a granny smith apple (should have added it all). this went together easily and has a nice complex taste without being complex to make. i wasn't sure if i'd like the potato in it but found that it was good. i served this over jasmine rice. thanks for sharing! made for zwt 6 zingo by one of the unrulies under the influence. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal momaphet reply 1 i lived in japan for 8 years and am so happy to find this website. my favorite dish in japan was katsudon and i would like to make it but don't know how to make the dashi stock. can someone help me? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frances n. reply see 1 reply delicious. the instructions for the substitutions are very helpful. i suggest not adding the apple because it doesn't really make a world of difference. i actually prefer mine without it. i added a few more tablespoons of curry powder just because i like the spice. do not add more water into this recipe unless the curry is starting to stick to the bottom as you're cooking. the best way to make a thick sauce is to use the chicken stock as specified in the instructions, while cooking with the lid closed. if needed, then add water to prevent from sticking<br/><br/>***important tip: after making the roux (after adding curry powder/tomatoes) i suggest using a shifter to dissolve the mix into the chicken stock. i find that this is the easiest way to thoroughly dissolve the roux. so basically, put your roux on the shifter, and dip the shifter into the stock, and mix the roux while it's in the shifter. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flying dumpling reply"
"first trial didn't turn out good but the texture is definately there. here's a few tips: 1) for first timer, to beat egg white to become foamy and peak, you must make sure the bowl and beater does not have oil. must be absolutely clean. don't use plastic bowl because oil tends to stay on it even after cleaning. egg white must not have even a slight egg yolk in it. normally people beat egg yolk first, but i am lazy. i beat the white first, so i don't need to clean the beater when i use for egg yolk. but you have to make sure you prepare all the ingredients and work fast. otherwise the foamy egg white will become flat. 2)you might need to consider reducing lemon juice or go with none. after reading other reviews, i reduced to 1 tbs, and still turned out too sour. i use fresh lemon juice. 3) baking time really varies. mine take 1.5 hours, using a square pan. 4) cool it in the oven that you turn off so it doesn't sink. 5) if you try to bake it without the roasting pan containing water, the side will burn very fast.

hope it helps! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kayarich reply 9 i baked this cake twice. once with full fat cream cheese and a second time with 1/3 less fat cream cheese. both time yielded excellent results with slight differences in texture. full fat cream cheese produced more moist but denser cake, whereas the 1/3 less fat one gave you dryer but fluffier cake. both are good depending on your mood and preferences. i also discover that using fresh lemon juice is key to achieve balanced flavor. bottled lemon juice just leaves that sharp lemony flavor that some reviewers seem to dislike. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal myoungp reply 6 delicious cheesecake! its like eating clouds, its so light and fluffy. just one note, the cheesecake should be left in the oven with the oven turned off after cooking for one hour for best results. thanks for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamadelogan reply 6 ""4 add half of the sugar, egg yolks, cornstarch and lemon juice.<br/> 5 beat until smooth.""<br/><br/>nope. beat the sugar, egg yolks, and lemon juice until light and fluffy; then add cornstarch all at once, and mix in on lower speed.<br/><br/>using the whisk attachment to the stand mixer, fold in 1/3 egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, then fold in all of egg whites immediately after.<br/><br/>this way, your cheesecake ends up higher and fluffier! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mar.ronquillo_10674 reply 3 i have made this cake 4 times now. i use 8oz of low fat cream cheese, 11/2 tbs lemon juice, and i also add in a little vanilla extract and a tiny amount of rum flavoring. this just adds the the decadence. i also use 1/2% milk, it makes for a nice low fat treat at coffee time. i bake for 20 minutes then have to put foil over it the rest of the time. i really do prefer the cake the next day after being refrigerated. very good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sabrinajosh reply 3"
"this was so fun to make. not the easiest thing but with practice it can get better! outside of that, it was super delicious with rice and wrapped in nori! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 thank you for this easy recipe! i just finished a roll.  i'm alarmed at the nutrition label next to the recipe.  i guess i have to share this. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal thisyearswinner reply 1 this is my favorite tamago recipe!  i think the sugar amount is just fine, and i use cooking wine instead of mirin and chicken stock instead of dashi.  thank goodness i don't still live alone--i was making this 3 times a week back then! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal annmlove reply 1 wonderful!  i cut the recipe in half because i have a small tamago pan, and it worked out perfectly.  both my husband and i enjoyed it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tea girl reply 1 this was just the thing i was looking for. thank you for reminding me of japan again! :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tiffany k reply 1"
"courgettes and other vegetables just need to add to the japanese cucumber salad while served with other appetizers or main courses. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jmdgamotia reply 2 fantastic side that goes with many main courses.  the flavor of this dish  hits all over your mouth.  a salty beginning, cool fresh middle and a good heat at the end.  definitely use rice vinegar over white.  to kick it up even more use 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp cayanne, and 1 or 2 cloves of garlic.  tastes like a cucumber kimchi. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hello kitty with cu reply 2 i absolutely love the flavor of sesame oil, so just had to try this and i was not disappointed. since there's only 2 of us, i did cut the recipe in half. i also am not fond of a watered down dressing, so i squeezed out as much water as i could out of the english cucumber that i used. delicious! :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lori mama reply 2 great tasty recipe which has the added bonus of being quick and easy to make.  in addition to adopting some of the suggestions (rice vinegar, red pepper flakes and green onions), i substituted lite soy sauce to reduce sodium without impacting taste.  this was a big hit at a potluck dinner with about 12+ hungry women! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal atlkarin reply 2 wonderful,tangy,and so simple . thank you so much .
 i also used rice vinegar and  about a tlbs of mirin.  i left out the mustard and added bias sliced green onions.added 1/2 tsp  red pepper flakes instead of tabasco.  i let the cucmbers and onions  marinate for about a hour. the only problem , we wanted more...  thanks icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal debbiekitchenwench reply 2"

"variations:
(use plastic food wrap to help mold it, and to keep it off your hands.)
fillings: *fuji`kko (preserved sea kelp? i don't know what this is called in english) *bonito flakes (katsuobushi) mixed with soy sauce to make a paste-like filling 

other variations:
*furikake (stuff you sprinkle on rice, like flavouring) various flavours... (furi - ""shake"" ka`ke -""ontop"")

i use this for when i make rice, and i want to have a healthy and fast snack in class (i'm a university student). i usually make a batch of rice, and then make 4 or 5 of these, using a new piece of plastic wrap each time. the piece used for each becomes the wrapping for the o`ni`gi`ri, so you can just make it and toss it (not literally...) in your bag. (^_^) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal makironi reply 11 it is essential that you use the right rice here people or this won't work. real sushi rice has a high starch content which makes it sticky. really, really sticky! sho-chiku-bai premium sweet rice made by koda farms is a great one to use. if you are lucky enough have an asian grocer nearby you can find it there. if not it can be purchased online. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal pigzen reply 2 i've never had onigiri or ever even seen it. it was so much fun to make and was so good! found the umeboshi at my local asian market in the refrigerated section. it's so good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 my favorite comfort food!!! makironi's suggestions were very helpful-- thank you!  i like the bonito flakes and furikake suggestions, and using plastic wrap to mold the rolls is great.  i am still practicing making the triangle shape, but the taste is always sensational.  yum! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal wen-wen reply 1 i used a filling of avocado, wasabi, soy sauce and mayo which was great. i couldn't get mine to stick together in one piece, though, and i tried another batch with sticky sushi-like rice which was even less cooperative. will have to practice! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sahs7930 reply"
"i had to cook this on top of the stove. i cooked the chicken in a pan and took out the water that came out and as soon as there was no more water i poured some of the sauce on top and sauteed it till it caramalized. used the left over sauce to drizzle on the chicken and wow. delicious! thank you for sharing a great recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal luvmybabies reply 3 these were awesome!!  i didn't have mirin so i used 1/4 cup rice vinegar.  thanks for posting!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal soda girl reply 2 great recipe! quick, easy & delicious. i'm a fan of any meat on a stick but this is some next level stuff. made as written w/garlic but had to sub white wine for mirin. grilled over medium heat & it turned out awesome. the sweet & salty chicken with the grilled onions is a perfect combo. definitely a keeper. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bigredchef reply 2 i can't believe i haven't written a review for this yet! this has become a go to recipe for me for over a year a now. it's easy, quick and, the best part, i usually have all the ingredients on hand. this is great with steamed or sauteed green beans or grilled veggies and rice ( with some of the extra sauce on the rice). if i'm feeling especially lazy, i don't skewer the chicken and just grill the thighs whole. thanks for sharing this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal skysmama reply 2 this was an excellent recipe.  quick, easy, tasty, and different--exactly what i needed!<br/><br/>i cooked mine on the foreman grill, and they came out really well!  thanks again, mianbao! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bigfatmomma reply 1 see 1 reply"

"for those who want extra sauce/glaze read here! i wanted to serve the chicken over rice but i wanted it to be saucy. i doubled the ingredients and did 10 drumsticks but i threw it all into a crock pot. i didn't want to have to stand over the stove so the crock pot was great! i let it cook for 4 hours on low, and next time i would throw in some thighs and maybe even breasts. there was sooo much extra sauce, that it almost needed more chicken. my husband and kids loved it, the sauce is delicious even by itself over rice! the crock pot made the chicken so tender it was just falling off the bone. i eventually did take all the meat off the bone, put it over the rice and spooned the sauce over..yummy! definitely a recipe that will stay with me forever, i even posted the recipe from this site onto my facebook status as ""tonights dinner!"" icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kristiekatz reply 143 i'm here to rave about this recipe too!  this is nearly always what i look for in a 5-star recipe - maximum flavour derived from minimum effort - and the effort for this recipe is practically nonexistent.  i skillet-toasted some sesame seeds and sprinkled these over the chicken pieces before serving.  steamed rice and oven-roasted brussels sprouts were the yummy others.  one thing i might do next time though, if i have a bit more time, is to brown the chicken pieces first - just to get a bit more attractive colour. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal evelynathens reply 38 just a thought for those of you who had difficulty getting your glaze to thicken.  dark meat that has not been skinned contains a lot of fat.  as you cook the chicken this fat becomes liquid (a liquid which will not reduce no matter how long you continue to simmer you sauce)  you may want to try grilling or other wise cooking the meat prior to adding it to the glaze.  you can then drain off the resulting fat.  this should enable you to thicken your glaze with greater ease and it will also reduce the saturated fat that the meal contains.  additionally, if you have the time you can put the sauce in the oven at 375 for half an hour to 45 min prior to starting your dinner.  this will further reduce the reduction time.  again, just a thought. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hillyar2 reply 29 what a wonderful, easy meal! this definitely falls into the ""finger lickin' good"" category for me. i followed the directions exactly and had no problems at all making this. i served it with basmati rice, green beans and baby corn. there was enough leftover glaze from the chicken to drizzle over the rice. next i plan to try this with chicken wings. thanks tomoko and toshiko for a truly outstanding recipe :-) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sackville reply 24 i used 6 skin-on, bone-in breasts, but halved them and browned them in a little olive oil.  drained the oil, added the sauce (doubled), and then removed chicken when it was almost cooked through.  reduced the sauce over high heat, which did take a good half hour or more, but once it starts to thicken, it thickens quickly.  added the chicken back in the pan and covered with sauce and cooked until chicken was done.  delish!  my family loved it, and thought it smelled great while cooking.  i used 3 cloves of minced garlic and about a tsp of red pepper flakes for the doubled sauce.  served with some broccoli and yellow rice.  will definitely make it again....really yummy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stacya100 reply 22"

"i would say my teenage son and i are ""mochi snobs"" except, considering the wildest version of this has all of half a dozen ingredients, there's not much to be snobbish about. at best, mochi is (let's face it) a mildly sweet, mildly satisfying, rice-based gummy... thing. and at its worst, well, it pretty much gets the same description.<br/><br/>that said, i live near enough to manhattan's midtown ""korea town"" and we frequent the asian market there which sells mochi in ever permutation and incarnation imaginable. so we've tasted hundreds of gut-busting pounds of the stuff over time, and decided this holds up and works well in a pinch when you need mochi.<br/><br/>we found it too pasty so it's not getting my highest rating. we did it stove top to avoid some of the uncooked aspects most of you had offered as downfalls of this, and i think it helped with the extra heat time (total: 5 or 6 minutes) and mixing. however next time i will double the water to extend the dough's open-time thus giving it more of a chance to really cook through.<br/><br/>a pam-sprayed ice cube tray makes the perfect interesting bite-sized bits, and freezer time will just help it set that much more quickly.<br/><br/>for a good saturday evening ""why not, let's try it"" thing, i give it an extra star above the 3 i'd normally grant. thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal casmarino reply 2 see 1 reply this is an awesome recipe for mochi -- i used confectioners sugar instead of katakuriko for dusting, and it added a bit of sweetness while eliminating the stickiness entirely. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal drew f. reply 2 see 1 reply thank you for this recipe! it is so easy and it can be tweaked for anyone's liking. i used coconut in mine after reading it in another recipe. i use 2 parts flour, 2 parts liquid (coconut milk, water, evaporated milk, etc), and 1 part sugar.  i also add butter and rum flavoring to mine. very tasty! it's even easier to microwave in a ceramic casserole dish with a glass lid so there's no messing with/wasting of plastic wrap.

the one thing that bothers me is that no matter what i do it still has a floury flavor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ashtears reply 2 i've never made mochi before and it was so simple! colored it green by just whisking a few drops of green food coloring into the water before adding it to the dry ingredients. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 i used regular flour for my recipe and personally it worked great! i didnt know where to find the japanese ingredients but i just used regualar flour and it tasted great! i put peanut butter in the middle and ive never had a better snack. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal trenyce j. reply"

"fyi: in japan, this is generally thought of as ""comfort food for when you're sick""...so it's meant to be easy on the stomach, not per se, super flavorful.  however, if you're not sick add more flavor by way of more flavorful (perhaps marinated) meat or adding nori/seaweed that has added ""oompf""...if the later, i recommend furukake, which can be found in specialty asian shops (if you don't live in hawaii, or in coastal big cities like san francisco or la) or in the asian section of your local grocery store/supermarket (if you do). icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nicole f. reply didn't really like it. it doesn't have much flavor. maybe it needs some type of seasoning other than the green tea, like salt or bonito. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal romi224 reply i make this often, comfort food to me. great for lunch on a cold day. the only things i do differantly is 1. i like to cut the nori into matchstick size strips and sprinkle over the top. 2. i have never used corriander but will next time. 3. sometimes i will steam the salmon with the rice (as is done in japan)or when doing this for lunch thoes new tuna steaks they sell now in a pouch are nice (a little dry but good for a quick lunch). if available sushimi is a nice topper too. 4. sometimes i will use a flavored green tea. mandarin orange flavored is nice with a pice of fish that was steamed with mandarin oringe slices, for example. i do this often with leftover sushi rice or will usually make extra jasmine rice (my fave) at dinner time for lunch the next day. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ilysse reply"

"this rice is ok, but not my favorite.  the lemon juice gives an unusual flavor that isn't in sushi rice.  also, it really isn't necessary to soak the rice for 12 hours.  sorry, this really just didn't work well for me.  made for 2009 spring pac icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kittycatmom reply"
