"i was absolutely speechless after my first bowl of this soup. i have never made a soup from scratch before and found it to be amazingly simple and easy, too. i refrigerated the soup in the dutch oven for two days rather than one -- something came up and so it was in a day longer than it calls for in the recipe. it was delicious but since i am a new widower and there is just me and the dog, i saved and froze equal portions for my two adult daughters. boy are they in for a surprise. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ron h. reply 6 awesome! this is a warm, comforting dish. the only modification i made was to infuse the olive oil with fresh, cracked garlic cloves instead of using the powder. it gave it a subtle hint of fresh garlic. also, i think that refrigerating it overnight to allow the flavors to combine and develop is essential if you have the time. absolutely wonderful - well done! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal indygrl87 reply 3 this is a soup that has perfectly balanced,deep,rich flavours.elegant enough for a dinner party,yet satisfying enough for a working lunch.
this recipe is also easy enough for those who are not terribly confident in the kitchen,to produce a great tasting dish.
a triumph-thank you for posting.
made for prmr. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal noo8820 reply 3 i've made this recipe countless times and it is always a wonderful treat! i made it this weekend, and had to use swiss and mozarella cheese (no gruyere in the house) and it turned out beautifully, as always.<br/>toasted up the french bread i made yesterday, with olive oil, salt, a bit of parmesan and oregano, cut into 2 inch cubes, makes it nice when you dig your spoon into that cheesy goodness to get a chunk of toast like that.<br/>thank you for sharing a really great soup recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamere reply 1 i was craving french onion soup and this hit the spot. my boyfriend ate it and he doesn't even really like french onion soup. (he was not a fan of the crouton, but that is personal preference.) i followed the directions as close as possible. i used cab merlot for the wine. and accidentally only bought 2 cartons of beef broth/stock (they don't sell broth where i live) which only equals 8 cups...so just made it with that. also i used dutch havarti for the cheese (it was on sale, looked like swiss and i couldn't find guyere) and that tasted good...as the melted cheese is my favorite part. lastly, i didn't let it sit over night as i was craving it and wanted it for dinner. still tasted good, but will probably taste just as good, if not better for tomorrows leftovers/dinner. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal robyntf reply 1"
"i loved that this recipe uses boneless skinless chicken thighs. i felt like they were super tender and the sauce tasted amazing. i highly recommend. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 i can’t believe that i actually did flaming cognac. it worked! the coq was just wonderful, and my husband agreed. surprisingly quick. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal libby j. reply"
"first of all, this is not a flan. it is clafouti. an entirely different recipe, so no comparing. pouring it over the fruit in the dish before you bake it is exactly how you do a clafouti. it's more on par of a yorkshire pudding than flan. it's supposed to be eggy. it's clafouti. that all being said, it is wonderful. i have made it many times and it's always delicious. i like the idea of using fresh plums so that will be my next one! :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal deborah h. reply 10 see 2 replies if you analyze the recipe, you can see it's going to be a custard rather than a cake. lots of milk and eggs, just a little flour. if you were expecting a cake, no wonder you were disappointed. try again if you like custardy and eggy, otherwise forget it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rlandre reply 6 this was delicious! i had never made clafouti before, and we were very pleased. i used frozen cherry-berry mixed fruit, which includes tart and sweet cherries, strawberries, blueberries and cranberries. i used 1/3 cup of sugar in the batter, and it tasted sweet enough so i didn't use all the rest called for. i did sprinkle about 2 tb more sugar over the top before baking. also, i did not do the 2-step baking process. after melting 2 tb of butter in the dish and spreading it over the interior, i put the fruit in the dish in an even layer, and poured the batter over the fruit. then sprinkled the 2 tb sugar over the top. as it baked, the fruit came to the top, and there was a layer of custard under the fruit when it was done. we ate it warm by itself, but it would be good with a little vanilla ice cream on top, or served cool with whipped cream. i will definitely make this again. i will probably add 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest next time, because it needed a little boost in flavor. it was really good with just the vanilla, though. definitely a keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cathyfood reply 6 see 2 replies i loved this recipe! i had some delicious fresh cherries, and i wanted a simple recipe to make something great. this was it! i also added about a cup of blueberries...wonderful! i especially liked that all the ingredients for the batter are things you usually have on hand. i will make this again for sure, and may try it with some other fruits mentioned in the comments here! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal juggler66 reply 6 this was very, very, very good! i made a couple of changes to fit our lifestyle:
1. rice milk for the milk
2. gluten free flour combo for the flour
3. only 1/4 cup of raw cane sugar in the batter and none on the cherries.
it was divine and i can't wait to try with whatever fruit is in season. thanks for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dancingpanda reply 5"
"best tasting steak i've ever made. the sauce really took it over the edge. cooked it just as directed and the steak had a nice sear/crust to it. served it with fries and of course, a large glass of red wine! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 simple recipe, complex & flavorful result! hubby said, “don’t lose that recipe!” so we will definitely make it again. thanks so much! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamarobin reply awesome. had no red wine so skipped this part but the meat turned out amazing and the sauce did too. registered here to review this recipe! well and maybe because i was drinking while cooking, too. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nastya a. reply i never rate recipes, but....this was the best!!! try it you will love it! i didn't have the parsley, and it was still amazing!!! can't wait to make it again! thanks for the awesome recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal clsicgrl81 reply this was amazing! it was not at all difficult, but the results were just fabulous. i served it with pommes puree (from recipe 495914) and a salad of hearts of romaine leaves and a ton of avocado with homemade vinaigrette. it was a marvelous dinner! my 8 year old, who has become rather suspicious of new foods, loved it. even my toddler, who is not a meat eater as a rule, ate up most of her good-sized portion! thank you so much for sharing this, french tart! maybe next time i can hold off the troops long enough to get a photo or two! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal halcyon eve reply"
"i don't care how many rapturous reviews you have for this recipe: the broth tastes terrible cooked this way. there are many recipes for mussels on the internet and they all agree that you should saute the shallots and garlic in butter (or olive oil) before adding the white wine etc. otherwise you are simply boiling them and they turn out bitter. addition of cream might help but why do it this way? it is interesting the number of reviewers who say they loved the recipe and yet they changed it substantially. apparently boiled onions can substitute for boiled shallots. i never usually write reviews but in this case i would like to save people from this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lawrence w. reply 8 see 1 reply very simple recipe with few ingredients but go a long way!!! i made this recipe twice in a row. the first time i followed it exactly and enjoyed it. the second time i didn't have enough wine so i substituted the rest with chicken broth and this time the results were even more satisfying!!! thank you for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal el g. reply 6 love this, but it can be made even better! tip: add 2/3 tablespoon dried tarragon with the garlic and shallots, and go a little heavier on the salt and butter. so good you’ll want to drink the sauce! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal john l. reply 6 i used three of the six tablespoon of butter to sauté the shallots and garlic before i added the wine. i added a few pepper flakes, sea sal towards the end. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michael s. reply 6 i found this to be very 'savory'.  i think that maybe the addition of sea salt may boost it up for us.  definitely a recipe to make again while tweaking it to our tastes.  thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal axe1678 reply 5"
"wow , these are amazing! they did not raise as much as i had hoped but still wonderful. i had to convert the measurements, it took me a long time so let me help someone else out! 1/2 c milk or 3 7/8 oz, 1/8 c water or 1 1/8 oz, 2 1/3 c flour + 1 tsp, 7/8 oz butter, 1 tsp yeast, 6 1/8 oz butter. i made half of them into regular croissants and filled the other half with a cream cheese and sugar mix with homemade strawberry jam. next time i will try the cream cheese mix and choc chips. i took them to work and everyone has made special requests for our monday meetings, thanks for the pics they really help! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal amber c. reply 12 i would give it 10 stars if i could!!!  this is hands downnn thee best thing ive ever made in my life!!!  follow the directions carefully and you will have perfection!!  the pictures are an immense help or i wouldve been lost.  i made mine with bonne maman raspberry preserve with a piece of dark lindt chocolate inside.  i wish id quadrupled the recipe...it doesnt make many, and this is definitely a recipe to have on hand to impress friends and family! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal healinghands111 reply 3 these are amazing and incredible easy (when following the pics).  for those converting to us units, i found that using 1 tbs of yeast worked well, and they turned out amazingly fluffy.  i make these randomly for friends and neighbors and everyone is surprised they didn't come from a bakery.  i lived in france for awhile and these bring me right back.  great to dunk into a fresh cup of coffee! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal taraleigh25 reply 3 5 stars for sure! these are amazing. although you do need to do quite a bit of work, i assure you it's well worth it! just make sure you use the pictures as a guide or it tends to get confusing. i just had them for breakfast and wow! buttery, soft, everything you want a croissant to be. the family cleared them off! next time i'll try different fillings. :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal amy 8295 reply 1 i had always been too scared of making croissants because they are apparently so hard to make - but i gave this a go by hand and they turned out very very good and not as hard as id thought! beautifully puffy and crispy; bit smaller and slightly less sugar and salt than the ones im used to, but that`s just a matter of preference:) next time ill try to baste the pastry pedantically including the exposed edges, which fanned out during baking (there were differences in the final feuilled 'look' according to whether they had egg on or not - even just a little missed bit was obvious :) also found it`s handy to keep an eye on them the last 5 minutes as they brown really quickly once they get going. the fridge time in between rolling - i wasnt sure so i left them in for about 15 minutes, then 30 mins after the 3rd rolling...is that about right? anyway they went well - my family and i loved them; you made it easy to follow; thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lightawake reply 1"

"i watched the film julie and julia and was intrigued. i was dying to see what the fuss was all about and although i detest mushrooms i decided to be brave and give it a try. yes it took all day to cook but for a mushroom hater likemyself it was to die for. the beef melted in your mouth and the sauce.  yum!!!!<br/>my family loved it and i felt so posh giving them 'beef bourguignon' for their sunday dinner.<br/><br/>bon appetit people!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vickiplum reply 9 i first had made ""tyler's ultimate beef stew.""  following that success, i read reviews and noticed that others had suggested julia's boeuf bourguignon as a ""head and shoulders"" above recipe.  i said to myself, ""self, we need to pick a sunday and try this.""  today, i did.  after 6-hours in the kitchen, i presented this dish to my family (a 10 y/o boy, a 9 y/o girl, my wife, and my mother in-law).  it was very quiet at my dinner table, except for the ""num, num, num,"" noises.  it is rare that my kids eat what i cook...their pallets favoring less complicated food.  this recipe was absolutely delicious.  like others, i did not take the time to remove the onions and carrots from the beef mixture prior to serving.  however, i did strain the sauce and reduced it until it coated the back of a spoon.  also, it is important to season and re-season throughout this process with salt and pepper.  i've read other reviews that said their result was bland...i'm assuming that they did not taste what they were cooking to adjust the seasoning...this step is crucial in any recipe.  i did add some leftover carrots with butter and parsley at the end, but everything else was according to recipe.  i used about 3 lbs of chuck roast, cut into 2 inch cubes and took time to ensure all pieces were well browned before continuing.  i wasn't able to find a 6 oz piece of slab bacon that wasn't sliced, so i substituted with oscar myer butcher's cut hickory smoked bacon.  i also used fresh pearl onions, and blanched them to remove the skins.  it did not take 40-50 minutes to cook...more like 20 minutes.  also, for the mushrooms...make sure your pan is hot, and on high-heat.  due to the water content in mushrooms...if the heat is too low, the water will release, and they will not brown...but rather stew in their own juice.  the beef braise took about 3 hours to cook at about 300 degrees (325 resulted in a rapid boil rather than a simmer).  i served mine over egg noodles.  final note...i used barefoot merlot and about 3 cups of beef stock for the braise.  if you decide to try this recipe...it will take half a day, but is worth the time.   i read another review below that said that this was not ""traditional"" in the sense that the author of the comment just returned from paris and had theirs made with white wine...and europeans don't eat rich food like this...etc.  sounds a bit pretentious to me...and having grown up in a german house...we ate a lot of rich food: is there anything more rich than liverwurst?  it's 100% cholesterol!  anyway, i digress, but i found the ladies comment to be amusing and had to retort.  anyway...have fun with this and enjoy.  bon appetite. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mark m. reply 8 see 1 reply i've been a julia fan for many many years but until today, i'd never tried this recipe.  forced retirement can have a fun and interesting side.  i have lots of time to cook labor intensive recipes now.<br/>i thought the recipe was delicious and even more than i expected.  i enjoyed every minute/hour of the process.   i felt a kindred spirit with julia as i got into this all day adventure.  and that's what it was for me, an adventure in real cooking,  not just meal preparation.<br/>i would make this again, and again.  i believe i'd do it even for just myself because i so enjoyed the experience. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal imjane reply 6 i've made julia's recipe several dozen times, this is an authentic version. several shortcuts that are not substitutes/major changes would be... for the first step, chop 3-4 slices of regular sliced bacon into 1 inch pieces and gently render in some oil, remove when crisp then use that oil to brown your beef. i've learned it's not necessary to strain out the onion and carrot, so i slice the carrot decoratively. i'd never skip her method of making the mushrooms, they are essential. and frozen pearl onions are fine, defrost, saute in butter til brown with thyme and s&p, then add some of the gravy from your main pot and simmer them for a bit, you just want them to have good color and be tender. in a pinch, just chop a medium onion into 8ths and proceed according to the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ccdeco reply 4 this is one of the best meals i have ever made.  i was cursing the number of steps and the time it took until everyone tasted it and wow!  we have now tried a few different versions and i learned some tips and tricks.  first, use frozen pearl onions that are already de-skinned.  if you dont mind peeling all the little onions, then cut one end and boil them for a few minutes and they should theoretically slip off, but when i did this, so did half the onion!  next, use a bouquet garni bag for the herbs.  cook the stew in a cast iron pot...for some weird reason it makes a difference.  dont use bad wine....if you cant afford a bordeaux, use meritage which is usually cheaper.  towards the end, add 1/4 cup of cognac...it really adds more depth and tastes great.  serve with mashed potatoes and more of the wine you cooked it in and definitely double the recipe and freeze the rest....it is wonderful as a leftover and it doesnt take much effort to make twice as much. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal steff0566 reply 4"
"my wife and i have been making this recipe for 40 years. sadly, she passed away just a few weeks ago and i have not been able to cook without her, but seeing this recipe has made me want to cook again. i will probably make it for our daughter and her husband when they come to visit. it has always been a favorite. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal donjay1947 reply 19 see 7 replies from bruce phillips (recent fan of genius kitchen) i'm a great fan of julia child beginning in the late 60s. at that time it was almost impossible to find ""supremes"" of chicken! you had to ""make"" your own. how times have changed. my wife and i made this dish over and over for friends whenever ""high feasts and holy days"" were in order but have not made it for decades. our four grown daughters have never tasted it. it came back on our radar recently and i will likely make it for my wife tomorrow night for valentines day. this december we will celebrate our 46th anniversary! the recipe is as i remember it. when we first encountered it we couldn't believe you could cook chicken breasts in such a short time. we've come a long way!! i can't imagine where what looks like sesame seeds got on the photo! we'll stick with the original! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal phil8182 reply 8 see 1 reply this recipe turns out perfect every time i have made it.

"i have heart disease so converted this to a heart healthy recipe.  i used turkey bacon (had to use a little extra olive oil), turkey sausage and boned skinless chicken thighs.  i cooked my own beans (tinned are high in sodium) and used extra garlic (not only good for the heart but delicious!).  served this up with a fabulous salad and some crusty whole grain bread!  we didn't feel like we were missing anything, this dinner felt like a ""cheat nite"". icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lynne12d_11193218 reply 7 this cassoulet was superb.  i did do a few things differently.  i had no bouquet garni so i use 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp parsley and a bayleaf which worked out perfectly.  after i was done browning the pork chops i deglazed the pan with the red wine mixture before putting it in the crock pot.  also, i used a tin of cherry tomatoes in place of the plain tomato.  i used white kidney beans for the bean.  the bread crumbs on top got mixed in during cooking in the crock pot, so i couldn't brown the top but it didn't seem to matterb because it was still delicious.  served it with mashed potatoes and ""carmelized butternut squash"" from this website. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mommymakeit4u reply 5 fantastic! i did a lot of research before undertaking cassoulet, and in the end i decided to base it on your recipe. the only thing i varied was the type of meat - i used a large ham hock, two duck breasts (browned in a pan beforehand to remove fat), some diced ham, and a chorizo sausage. i served it with sautã©ed savoy cabbage and a fresh homemade baguette. it was fattening, but soooo good! thanks for a great recipe :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal barrdbarrbarr reply 5 it was my first time making cassoulet and this recipe made it easy. i used a 2-qt dutch oven and, hot italian sausages, and chicken thighs. the recipe calls for about 1 lb of sausages, but i used three sausages instead (about 10oz) and about three chicken thighs (about 12oz) and it was plenty of meat. i cut the carrots in diagonal slices for nicer presentation. i also added quartered mushrooms, which i sauteed separately and added to the pot 

this recipe definitely tasted good (what wouldn't with all that meat, red wine, and herbs?), but i only wish it looked more appealing in color. it was all very brown and even the breadcrumbs were a dark brown, not a golden crust like i imagined. 

i made fresh bread crumbs by cutting 1-in cubes of a big loaf (including crust) and mixing with olive oil combined with dried herbs (oregano, thyme, rosemary, and/or basil). then bake flat on a sheet at 400 degrees for about 10 mins or until crispy then smashing with a rolling pin in a ziploc bag with no air. 

i served the cassoulet with the rest of the bread from the loaf i used for breadcrumbs, as well as mashed garlic red potatoes. this recipe is worth the wait for it to cook. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vusandra reply 4 i've never had cassoulet before and so this was my first time making it. wow. everything was delicious. the meat and sausages were tender and the sauce was incredible. will definitely be making this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3"

"excellent recipe!  i have been trying for some time, with great frustration, to perfect the art of making spaetzle.  well - it is now obvious to me that it really isn't hard at all - you just need the correct recipe.  this was absolutely perfect - the batter was nice and thick and not gloppy, like so many others i had previously tried.  i used a spaetzle maker and it came out as good as any i've ever eaten in my favorite restaurant here in germany. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal heatherfeather reply 17 delicious, we had a lot of fun making it, need to get the spaetzle maker or machine, it is very good, first time making spaetzle, my dh loved it, he also helped making it. recipe is a keeper. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal barb g. reply 17 i was taught by my grandmother how to do this.  it's not always about exacts, but texture.  our spaeztle tends to be a little thicker.  instead of a machine or colander just put some on a cutting board and ""slice""/push it off at desired size into the water.  so much easier and  heartier! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal brandylynn reply 3 yes, another review.  i made the recipe almost exactly the way you have it ~ however, i don't much care for nutmeg so i left it out.  i boiled up some chicken, skimmed the fat off, added salt & pepper, some onions, diced some celery & carrots and potatos.  then i brought it to a simmer until all veggies were done.  i don't have a spaetzle machine, so i improvised.  i decided to try something different than a colander or cutting the dough.  i have a potato ricer and i put it through that.  well let me tell you, it was a little tough as the dough was a bit thick, but i did get it through.  almost perfect.  i then boiled them for about 7 minutes turned the burner off and let it cool a bit.  wonderful!  absolutely delicious!  i think next time i make them i will add some green onion to the dough, a great color and i bet it will taste fantastic!  thank you for the yummy recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal smile1968 reply 3 excellent.  made a half-recipe.  no spaetzle machine or colander with large enough holes, so i did it the old-fashioned way: scraped noodles off a flat plate into the boiling water with a butterknife.  some were a little thick, but tasty none-the-less.  served with sauerbraten.  teenage son ate the left-overs for a late-night snack. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal archiemom reply 2"

"great brioche.  this replaces the recipe that i've been using for years - andre soltner's - his has way more butter, almost too much.    i made this before i had a new food processor, so since the whole thing was by hand, i halved the quantity so that it was managable.    getting the butter into the dough by hand is quite an experience.  step 16 is important for cooks new to brioche making.  at one point it's inevitable that you think that this time it will never come together.  but, it does.  thanks petitfour. beautiful bread and great directions. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jangomango reply 12 wow. i used this recipe as a tester for my new (used) kitchen-aid mixer. this also happened to be my first time making any sort of bread (with the exception of failed beignets a year or so ago and some irish soda bread that doesn't require yeast). this was a very long process seeing as i started it in the morning with the intent on baking it tonight. i did manage to do it all in one day but it has taken quite awhile. the result however is an incredibly soft and delicious brioche that i am more than ecstatic about. brioche is hard to find in stores around here and the few that have it charge roughly $6 for 1/2 of a loaf (and its nowhere near as good). extremely happy with this recipe and will absolutely be making again...and again...and again.... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lukeout007 reply 8 this was first attempt at making bread in a loaf pan. for such a detailed 38 step recipe, there are some glaring problems. in the ingredients add 1 more egg for the egg wash.step 29 and 30 are confusing. i thought i was making a loaf of bread - not biscuits!  dividing dough into thirds making three loafs, experiment! you do not have to make the biscuits. what size loaf pan are we to use? i used 2 - pyrex 8.5x4.5  and a metal one 9x5 or so. the bread didn't fill any of the pans when done. in the metal one, the loaf came out a lot easier than the pyrex. all three were well buttered. i used very little egg wash and made sure in was only on the top, not dribbling into the pan. and what shelf did you bake in the oven at? i started in what i thought was the middle. at least it was the middle setting. i had to lower the rack, at twenty minutes because the top was golden brown already.i also had a thermometer in the oven, and yes i was baking at 375. i went down to the second rack setting to the bottom, which put the loafs in the middle of the oven. this was on me, now i know better. the bread had great texture, but the crust was too dark and crunchy. when you start out by stating to follow exactly, then give us 38 steps, please give us a recipe without leaving out anything. the bread itself deserves more than two stars but the lengthy instructions missing steps and the missing egg deserves less than one star. i feel this was a waste of a day in the kitchen. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tony v. reply 6 this is a great recipe!!!!i followed exactly the process, then divided into balls and froze them i thaw in refridgerator over night then put in a very small bread pan, and bake.  yummy bread !!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frenchy cabernet reply 5 i am not a baker by any standards, 'cept when it comes to bread puddin' - i can throw down!  but this recipe is ah-mazingggg!!!  i mimicked every step in the recipe, minus putting it in a pan and baking it.  my husband and son loved to go to mimi's cafe on the weekends for their ""cinnamon brioche french toast"" so i decided to finally put this recipe to use, to create a home-made version.  i posted the picture up (hopefully, it gets approved): one loaf, i braided it like challah bread and the other, i mocked a cinnamon roll, then braided it.  for the cinnamon roll version, i flattened the dough, poured melted butter and slabbed on a generous mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar.  then i rolled it like a cinnamon roll to make it into one large loaf.  i then took scissors and made three even cuts, be sure not to cut it all the way, leave the top part to 'tuck' under.  i braided it, gently placed it in a loaf pan, brushed egg wash and baked it as prescribed.  my boys loved it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rsprovost reply 3"

2. separate the eggs and whip the whites and set aside.
3. start melting the chocolate (if you're like me and using a double boiler). 
4. start the sugar/water combo. then follow from there.

"i had to change a few things.  first, i used cube steak as i didn't have any chicken on hand.  i didn't pound it as it was already quite thin.  next, i didn't have swiss cheese so i used string cheese from my kid's lunchbox.  i didn't have ham so i used spinach instead.  now, i did roll it up as per the recipe, that was great!  finally, i didn't have thyme so i skipped entirely.  i decided to cook it on the stove top as my oven was broken.   i paired it with tater tots (heated in the microwave) and beef jerky.   possibly the best chicken cordon bleu i've ever had!

"a french classic that i make now and then when i have time! this recipe certainly delivered on technique as well as flavour. i made it exactly as posted - i even managed to get a pig's trotter from my bucher in the village. i make mine with madeira wine, but i rather liked this as an alternative - it was lighter and fresh in flavour. i have parsley growing all over the back garden, so this was an ideal opportunity to make this for the herb of the month tag game in the gardening and herbs forum - although i saved this recipe when i first saw it in the recipe promo ""give me a j""  in cc. i made this for a dinner party starter - we ate it with homemade bread, cornichons and watercress. sorry, no sliced photos jan - but i did manage to get photos in the afternoon before i served this. a note: you need to allow yourself lots of time for this recipe, and i also increased the gelatine a wee bit - experience has taught me that even with the the additon of the pig's trotter, you need a firm setting agent to hold all the ham and parsley layers together. excellent! thanks for posting. ft

"so used maille old style mustard, used two rabbits instead one and no bacon as that would change flavour and used bones for condensed stock, cut legs and wings off and tenderloin down back and boiled rest for stock, super tasty recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jupiter c. reply amazing. i hydridized by both coating the rabbit with dijon and dredging it (do be careful not to burn while browning).  used course stone-ground mustard for the sauce.  invest the time in making a good stock for this recipe...i had some frozen duck stock on hand (sick tradition of having a ""mother stock"" that we add to over time, haven't killed anyone yet, it culminates on thanksgiving).  added extra fresh thyme and served with mashed potatoes with crumbled bacon and chives.  really, heavenly.  for those squeamish about rabbit, it would also work with bone in, skin-on chicken thighs. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sharleneb reply great recipe! first time making it. the sauce was tasty, you can definitely taste the wine in the sauce. the only thing i did extra is added 2 cups of fried mushrooms into the sauce with meat. i felt that the mushrooms gave it more flavor and added more texture to the dish. oven time was 60 min.  rabbit turned out tender. 
thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal foodymoody reply i made a half recipe tonight for two of us. i'm guessing my wild rabbit was around 2lbs and i had heaps of sauce to smother our mashed potatoes in. i avoid flour thickened sauces so used low sodium chicken stock then after removing the cooked rabbit pieces, reduced the juices until they were a nice thick consistency. then i added in the cream and mustard and returned the rabbit to that for a few minutes. my rabbit was cooked perfectly after 50 minutes as it wasn't quite as large as you used. i had to use dried thyme as i couldn't get fresh. i'll try it again with fresh as i love the stuff. i also used duck fat in place of the olive oil-i think that added to the luxury taste of the dish. this is one of the best rabbits i have ever cooked-if you didn't know your rabbit from chicken, you'd have thought it was chicken it was so tender. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal justjans reply loved the recipe so much that it's become a ""company"" dish for us.  we live in france, and rabbit is a popular dish here -which means there is stiff competition in terms of recipes!  but, i've had rave reviews each time i've served this!  and, yes, i agree about adding additional sauce.  it's so-o-o-o delicious. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal englishprof reply"

"dh loves raisin bread and i made this as a treat for him. he gave it 5 fingers up with a grin. i did make one tiny alteration in that i soaked the raisins in 1/4 cup of rum and a 1/4 cup of water and then used the soaking mix with enough water to make up what the raisins had absorbed in place of the milk. if there is one thing he likes better than raisin bread it's rum-raisin bread. the recipe is a snap to make and it well filled an 8x4 loaf pan. i did;t use the parchment, just sprayed the pan and the bread fell out perfectly. my loaf didn't turn out even and pretty but it sure pleased dh :d. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal annacia reply was intending to give part of this to a friend of mine, then ended up freezing a portion of the loaf instead! did plump up the raisins before using them! absolutely great tasting bread, especially when served either warm or slightly toasted, with a small amount of raisin sauce as a spread! thanks for posting your recipe!

"a wonderfully delicious salad with very clear instructions.  i made a few small changes to meet my taste preferences: i used two medium-sized onions and added three cloves of minced garlic in step two, and used only 11/2 tablespoons of dijon mustard, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  a great blend of flavours and textures which my luncheon guests and i really enjoyed.  thank you for sharing this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bluemoon downunder reply 1 this is a stellar salad! the only change i made was to use extra virgin olive oil, a splurge i usually make for salads, and well worth it in this case. i cannot sing enough praises for this salad. thanks, deecooks! made for 123 hit wonders tag. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mersaydees reply 1 this recipe can't be faulted in any way - it is simply sensational.  well-written and easy to make.  we got a very flavourful salad which was enjoyed by the entire family. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal evelynathens reply 1 this is very tasty.  the only change i would make next time is adding garlic as suggested by one of the other reviewers. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal iris5555 reply this was very good and has a lot of flavor. i wanted to make the light version of this, so used lean turkey bacon (and halved it) and only one teaspoon of olive oil. i also subbed half broth for the water, since i had it in the frig, added two cloves of garlic to the pot, and left out the mustard and raw onions for personal preferences. my only ""complaint"" would be if the amount of liquid were to match what the lentils absorb, there would be one less step of having to drain them. but that doesn't take away from the yummy flavor of this. i think tiny chunks of cooked potatoes would be awesome in this! portions are very generous, i would say this feeds 10-12 people. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal maito reply"
"my mother fell in love with escargot on a cruise, and i tried several recipes before i found one that lived up to her gastronomic memories. it is, of course, this one!

the balance of butter, parsley, and garlic is perfect in this recipe.  others i tried were overpowered by the parsley or garlic.  and, as bob noted, the brandy sends this dish over the top.  

i used escargot dishes rather than shells.

""wow!""  ok, enough silliness. i made these as indicated, except i couldn't find sun-dried tomato paste in two usually well-stocked stores, so i used a very flavorful sun-dried tomato tapenade. for the herbs, i used fresh rosemary, thyme and sage leaves. nothing short of spectacular, ft.  consider me in your debt for this one! :d icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sandi from ca reply 1 fantastic meal! i used turkey escalopes and for the pork sausage recipe #190045. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rosslare reply as has already been said fabulous! this recipe has been in the planning and in my cookbook for quite some time just waiting to be made - there was no doubt in my mind as to which recipe i was going to make for my swap partner. i love bundles - they add such an elegance to a meal and always impress. that this tastes as good as the flying chef's photo looks it makes for a company quality meal. thank you for sharing - it's been added to my company cookbook. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gerry reply this is absolutely gorgeous!! we loved, loved and loved this. the combination of sausage stuffing with the pork and then served with the mushroom sauce is outstanding. i especially loved, that for such an elegant meal, that is definitely company worthy, it is so easy to make with such a wonderful end result. i served ours with potato dauphinoise with just the mushrooms and it was so good. a great post ft icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal the flying chef reply"
"i watched the film julie and julia and was intrigued. i was dying to see what the fuss was all about and although i detest mushrooms i decided to be brave and give it a try. yes it took all day to cook but for a mushroom hater likemyself it was to die for. the beef melted in your mouth and the sauce.  yum!!!!<br/>my family loved it and i felt so posh giving them 'beef bourguignon' for their sunday dinner.<br/><br/>bon appetit people!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vickiplum reply 9 i first had made ""tyler's ultimate beef stew.""  following that success, i read reviews and noticed that others had suggested julia's boeuf bourguignon as a ""head and shoulders"" above recipe.  i said to myself, ""self, we need to pick a sunday and try this.""  today, i did.  after 6-hours in the kitchen, i presented this dish to my family (a 10 y/o boy, a 9 y/o girl, my wife, and my mother in-law).  it was very quiet at my dinner table, except for the ""num, num, num,"" noises.  it is rare that my kids eat what i cook...their pallets favoring less complicated food.  this recipe was absolutely delicious.  like others, i did not take the time to remove the onions and carrots from the beef mixture prior to serving.  however, i did strain the sauce and reduced it until it coated the back of a spoon.  also, it is important to season and re-season throughout this process with salt and pepper.  i've read other reviews that said their result was bland...i'm assuming that they did not taste what they were cooking to adjust the seasoning...this step is crucial in any recipe.  i did add some leftover carrots with butter and parsley at the end, but everything else was according to recipe.  i used about 3 lbs of chuck roast, cut into 2 inch cubes and took time to ensure all pieces were well browned before continuing.  i wasn't able to find a 6 oz piece of slab bacon that wasn't sliced, so i substituted with oscar myer butcher's cut hickory smoked bacon.  i also used fresh pearl onions, and blanched them to remove the skins.  it did not take 40-50 minutes to cook...more like 20 minutes.  also, for the mushrooms...make sure your pan is hot, and on high-heat.  due to the water content in mushrooms...if the heat is too low, the water will release, and they will not brown...but rather stew in their own juice.  the beef braise took about 3 hours to cook at about 300 degrees (325 resulted in a rapid boil rather than a simmer).  i served mine over egg noodles.  final note...i used barefoot merlot and about 3 cups of beef stock for the braise.  if you decide to try this recipe...it will take half a day, but is worth the time.   i read another review below that said that this was not ""traditional"" in the sense that the author of the comment just returned from paris and had theirs made with white wine...and europeans don't eat rich food like this...etc.  sounds a bit pretentious to me...and having grown up in a german house...we ate a lot of rich food: is there anything more rich than liverwurst?  it's 100% cholesterol!  anyway, i digress, but i found the ladies comment to be amusing and had to retort.  anyway...have fun with this and enjoy.  bon appetite. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mark m. reply 8 see 1 reply i've been a julia fan for many many years but until today, i'd never tried this recipe.  forced retirement can have a fun and interesting side.  i have lots of time to cook labor intensive recipes now.<br/>i thought the recipe was delicious and even more than i expected.  i enjoyed every minute/hour of the process.   i felt a kindred spirit with julia as i got into this all day adventure.  and that's what it was for me, an adventure in real cooking,  not just meal preparation.<br/>i would make this again, and again.  i believe i'd do it even for just myself because i so enjoyed the experience. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal imjane reply 6 i've made julia's recipe several dozen times, this is an authentic version. several shortcuts that are not substitutes/major changes would be... for the first step, chop 3-4 slices of regular sliced bacon into 1 inch pieces and gently render in some oil, remove when crisp then use that oil to brown your beef. i've learned it's not necessary to strain out the onion and carrot, so i slice the carrot decoratively. i'd never skip her method of making the mushrooms, they are essential. and frozen pearl onions are fine, defrost, saute in butter til brown with thyme and s&p, then add some of the gravy from your main pot and simmer them for a bit, you just want them to have good color and be tender. in a pinch, just chop a medium onion into 8ths and proceed according to the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ccdeco reply 4 this is one of the best meals i have ever made.  i was cursing the number of steps and the time it took until everyone tasted it and wow!  we have now tried a few different versions and i learned some tips and tricks.  first, use frozen pearl onions that are already de-skinned.  if you dont mind peeling all the little onions, then cut one end and boil them for a few minutes and they should theoretically slip off, but when i did this, so did half the onion!  next, use a bouquet garni bag for the herbs.  cook the stew in a cast iron pot...for some weird reason it makes a difference.  dont use bad wine....if you cant afford a bordeaux, use meritage which is usually cheaper.  towards the end, add 1/4 cup of cognac...it really adds more depth and tastes great.  serve with mashed potatoes and more of the wine you cooked it in and definitely double the recipe and freeze the rest....it is wonderful as a leftover and it doesnt take much effort to make twice as much. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal steff0566 reply 4"
"awesome recipe! my wife is not usually too keen on trying new things but she loved it. i used meat from the shoulder and neck. i posted a picture of the end result. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal danielbledsoe reply this was excellent.  i used backstrap and cut it up into little medallions and followed the directions as written.  it was fantastic!  i am really trying to eat more lean game meats and this works beautifully, is hearty, and actually great for you. thanks for posting! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tropical texan reply wow, this is delicious. instead of cubbing the meat i used about 3 lbs venison chops and left them whole with the bone in. i followed the same instructions for the rest of the recipe. i will add this recipe to my wild meat recipe cookbook at home. this was enjoyed by hubby and kids also. i made an account here just so i could rate this recipe :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sandycooks reply"
"i agree with another reviewer and this recipe is for only 2 people. luckily i doubled the recipe and made with fresh onions, we were in 5 people at the christmas dinner table. everyone loved them. i served with smoked prime rib, mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. thank you for sharing the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal janelagomarsino reply very nice side dish chef. i used fresh white pearl onions, boiled and shocked to peel. i also made extra broth and froze to use as a starter base for french onion soup later this month..thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe chef kate icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamere reply this is a very simple but delicious recipe. the recipe is very easy to follow. everyone loved them. next time i'll use the fresh onions, (only for a little more flavour) thanks for a great recipe. made for the aussie/nz aug 2008 recipe swap. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal porfavorcorona reply yum! i omitted the parsley and salt. otherwise i followed the recipe exactly, and it was so good we ate all of it (2 people, not four.) thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jenpo reply excellent. using frozen pearl onions reduced cooking time and prep.
served with real russian stroganoff- #113810. good combination. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal muffy413 reply"
i too have pol's cookbook and this is a very good recipe.  i do substitute top sirloin for the blade steak.   also when browning the onions and mushrooms i sprinkle them with a little brown sugar.  definitely a reliable recipe and can be made ahead.  actually tastes better when it rests overnight in the fridge. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal waynejohn1234 reply

"a great rendition of boeuf bourguignon! a few changes...took the carrots out and the beef broth, using just a whole bottle of wine for liquid. use a dry'ish red wine if doing it this way, since the heavier wines can still have pretty strong smell and taste if you are only cooking for the 6 hours. i've cooked this 4-5 times, and i found that 10-12 hours was better than the shorter amount. the meat is more tender and there's no apparent decrease in the other great flavors. usually pair this with brussels sprouts and garlic or parmesan mashed potatoes. i use stew meat that is already cut up in chunks at the supermarket - usually lovely quality meat and less expensive. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jdevaud reply thank you for this recipe!!!!we love it and can't wait to serve it to friends over some board games and cards!  a side note...we used stew meat and mushroom broth, which worked out great. plus, i think we doubled the broth and wine because we love the sauce!!! thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal afoshee reply delicious, although this doesn't cook long enough for me to complete a work day: 6 hours, add 2 things, cook 1 1/2 hours more.  julia child's version in my le creuset pot is still my favorite recipe if i will have to hang around, but the slow cooker doesn't generate as much heat during the summertime.  sauteeing the mushrooms separately and adding them at serving time guarantees that the mushroom caps can maintain their shape.  i used frozen white pearl onions, thawed and patted dry, and venison stew meat (similar in character to round steak), and both choices worked quite well.  thanks for posting your version, sage!  made for 1-2-3 hit wonders tag. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal katel reply i made this for zaar world tour iii.

it's perfect. very flavorful, tender beef balanced by sweet onions and crisp carrots. and so easy. 

you did a great job converting this to the slow cooker, the timing is perfect. thanks for a great recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal emmyduckie reply oh wow!  this is delcious and soooo easy!  another one to add to my slow cooker recipes for use in the rv.  i would only make one change.  more red wine and less beef bouillon.  will try that next time.  thanks for posting this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal outta here reply"
"i changed recipe slightley. i added the can of tomatoes with its juce instead of fresh tomatoes. have never used so much garlic but thought id try the right amount. it was fabulous even my hubby loved it so told him after eating how many cloves  he said i should reply to say how great it was. and many thanks.!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal geejay 2 reply 5 i took a few liberties with your recipe. i cut out the tomatoe juice, changed the stock from beef to chicken and increased the stock  to make up for cutting out the tomatoe juice and it was super.  is'nt it amazing how many people are afraid to use 30 cloves of garlic?  it is the natural source of wellness!  thanks!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bergy reply 5 i love the flavor that this soup has!  i had to make a double-batch because i just couldn't get enough of it!  i didn't make any changes or substitutions, i liked it as is.  thank you for this yummy recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal shellbelle reply 1 just made this for dinner--fiance doesn't really like soup but i love it, so i'm always looking for good garlicky soups to make, because he loves garlic! like bergy, i replaced the tomato sauce with chicken broth and used all chicken broth instead of beef broth. i think i used about 30 cloves of garlic. i'm serving this with pasta shells stuffed with ricotta, zucchini, spinach and garlic with tomato sauce. this soup is perfectly seasoned and satisfying. thanks for posting!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal spatchcock reply 1 fantastic soup!  i followed the recipe except added a shot of vodka at the end. i donâ€™t care for vodka except in pasta sauce and now this soup. i used shredded swiss cheese. canâ€™t wait for summer tomatoes and will make and share this often.  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal linda.whigam reply"
