"directions preheat oven to 400*f. cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water until tender, 5-7 minutes. drain and reserve in the same pot you cooked them inches. heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. add the onions and cook until soft, 5 minutes, then addd the jalapeno, ginger, garlic, coriander, curry powder, cumin, allspice, cinnamon, and salt and pepper. cook for about 3 minutes more. stir in the drained potatoes, tomato, and peas. cook for another minute. stir in enough of the stock to moisten the mixture, then remove it from the heat and let cool. on a lightly floured surface, unroll ;the pie dough. cut each dough round into 8 equal wedges, like a pizza. spoon 1 tbls. of the potato filling onto the middle of each wedge. brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash and fold up, bringing the three points together over the filling, then pinching at the seams to form a small pyramid. transfer to a baking sheet and brush the samosas with the egg wash. bake 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. while the samosas bake, make the dipping sauce: combine the mint, cilantro, jalapeno, sugar, salt, lime juice, 1 tbls. water, and the oil in the bowl of a food processor. grate the garlic and ginger directly into the bowl, then puree until smooth. transfer to a small serving bowl. serve the samosas hot out of the oven with the mint cilatro dipping sauce."
"directions sift the flour, chilli powder, turmeric, baking powder and salt together in a bowl. get as much air into it as possible. crush the seeds in mortar and pestle, add to the bowl. now add the green chilli, onions and the chopped coriander. mix in some water to make a thick batter that holds the ingredients together. heat the oil in a wok. drop spoonfulls of the batter into the oil and fry till golden brown. place on kitchen paper to allow the excess oil to run off. these can be eaten as they are or with a dip."
"directions dough: make the dough by combining the milk powder, flour, butter. add just enough whole milk to make a medium-hard dough. divide the dough into 18-20 portions. make balls by gently rolling each portion between your palms into a smooth ball. place the balls on a plate. cover with a damp yet dry kitchen towel. heat the oil on high and then lower the heat to medium. slip in the balls into the hot oil from the side of the pan, one by one. they will sink to the bottom of the pan, but do not try to move them. instead, gently shake the pan to keep the balls from browning on just one side. after about 5 mins, the balls will rise to the surface. the gulab jamuns should rise slowly to the top if the temperature is just right. now they must be gently and constantly agitated to ensure even browning on all sides. if the temperature of the oil is too high then the gulab jamuns will tend to break. so adjust the temperature to ensure that the gulab jamuns do not break or cook too quickly. the balls must be fried very slowly under medium temperatures. this will ensure complete cooking from inside and even browning. sugar syrup: the syrup should be made earlier and kept warm. to make the hot sugar syrup add mix the 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water. add 4-5 cardamom pods, slightly crushed and a few strands of kesar (saffron). mix with a spoon and then heat at medium heat for 5-10 minutes until sugar is all dissolved in water. do not overheat, that will caramelize the sugar. transfer this hot syrup into a serving dish. keep warm on stove. add the fried gulab jamuns directly into the warm syrup. leave gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup overnight for best results. they can be served warm or at room temperature."
"directions to make the chutney, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil a medium sauce pan over medium heat. add onions and cook until golden and caramelized, about 8-10 minutes. stir in chili flakes, ginger, mango, curry powder, honey, white wine vinegar and water. bring mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until liquid has reduced by half and chutney has thickened, about 25-30 minutes. remove from heat and stir in lemon zest and mint. allow to cool to room temperature, then transfer to a jar and seal it tightly before refrigerating."
"directions method: filling. warm two tablespoons of ghee in a nonstick saucepan. as it melts, add the cooked pigeon peas, and stir until the water evaporates and the mixture thickens. continually scrape the sides of the saucepan to ensure even distribution of heat or else the daal will burn. add half the sugar and stir it in well. adjust to desired sweetness. reduce the heat and continue to thicken until the mashed pigeon peas resemble mashed potatoes. add the crushed cardamom powder, saffron and nutmeg, stir well and portion into eight pieces. this filling can be made up to 3 days in advance, and stored in the fridge until ready to use. bring it to room temperature to ease the rolling process. method: dough. using a food processor fitted with an s blade or in a large bowl, combine the flour with salt and enough water to make a firm dough. the dough should be firm but not hard, moist but not wet, and similar in consistency of modeling clay. carefully knead the oil into the dough and cover with a clear wrap or lid until ready to roll. method: rolling & cooking. start by rolling out a single ball of dough into a flat disk, as one would begin a paratha, no more than 5” diameter. place the mashed sweetened pigeon peas mash, puran, in the center, pinch the dough and fold over the ball to cover the ball completely, like a dumpling. ensure the seams are sealed. lightly flatten this in the palm of your hand. dredge the ball in dry flour and begin to roll again, this time very lightly to ensure the filling does not spill out. roll to make an 8” poli using dry flour to dust as needed. when sufficiently rolled, dust off excess flour. heat a shallow nonstick pan on medium-high heat. when ready to place a puran poli in the pan, turn it down to medium heat. the side that hits the pan first is the first side. watch the dough bubble slightly and move it around in the pan without flipping it over. turn the puran poli over approximately 1 minute later. the first side should be lightly spotted but not have dark spots. if this happens too quickly, reduce the heat. repeat on the second side, and while the second side cooks, lightly baste the first side of the with ghee. using a spatula, flip the paratha and repeat the basting. both sides should have ghee—cooked once without ghee and once with ghee. remove from heat and cover with a paper towel or a colander to help the steam evaporate. once they have come to room temperature, the puran poli can be transferred to an appropriate storage container."
"directions boil 1 cup water with sugar, rock salt, ginger, and cumin to make a simple syrup. add remaining water and lemon juice. chill to ice cold. pour over ice or blend with ice."
"directions mix ingredients for the first marinade. add chicken pieces and marinate for 25-30 minutes. dry-roast coriander seeds in frying pan over a medium-high heat for 2 minutes. add cumin seeds and dry-roast for 30 seconds. grind these spices in blender, or mortar & pestle, then mix them in non-metallic bowl with other ingredients for second marinade. salt to taste, and add chicken pieces. marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. thread the marinated chicken pieces onto metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers. pre-heat a grill, chargrill or grill pan to hot. grill the skewered chicken, turning a few times, so that the chicken gets cooked evenly from all sides. remove the chicken from the grill. take the pieces off the skewers and place on a plate. for tomato masala heat ghee, or oil in frying pan. when the ghee is ready, turn the heat to medium-high and fry coriander seeds and cinnamon stick for 1 minute. add bay leaves, cloves, green cardamoms and black peppercorns, and fry for 1 more minute. now add halfed tomatoes and stir for 2-3 minutes. add 125 ml of hot water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium, and cover with a lid. after 20 minutes remove skin from the tomatoes and continue to simmer until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated. now remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves from tomato masala and blend it with a hand-held blender and pass it through a sieve to obtain smooth puree. set this masala aside. for the gravy heat the ghee in frying pan. when the ghee is hot, add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. fry for 10-15 minutes, or until onions are tender and golden. in the meantime, put almonds and desiccated coconut in blender and grind to powder. now grind this almond-coconut powder with double cream and a little water to make a fine paste. when the onions are golden add garlic, ginger, and green chillies, and fry for 1 minute. then add turmeric, paprika  and cumin and saute for 30 seconds. put in the tomato masala, almond-coconut paste, tomato paste, honey and 125 ml of hot water. cook for 10 minutes, or until sauce starts to thicken. remove the curry sauce from the heat, and blend it again with the hand-held blender until smooth. return to a clean pan, reheat again and add cheddar cheese. when the cheese is melted, slowly whisk in the cream. add dry fenugreek leaves, garam masala and salt to taste. put in the chicken pieces and stir for 3-4 minutes over medium heat. to finish the dish, stir in the chopped coriander leaves. serve with naan bread or pilau rice."
"directions mix together flour, baking powder and salt. stir in the yogurt till the dough is too stiff for a spoon, then knead it in the bowl till it holds together well, adding more flour if necessary. turn it out on a floured surface and continue kneading for about 5 minutes till the dough feels smooth and elastic. form the dough into a ball and put it in an oiled bowl, covered with a towel, to rest for an hour or longer. take the dough out and cut it into 10 equal pieces. form each into a ball and press the balls flat into round discs. heat a large frying pan or griddle, either seasoned cast iron or a good non-stick finish. heat your oven to about 500 and have the broiler on (this is how the original recipe states it - i know with my oven it's either 500 degree oven or the broiler, but you get the idea. take 1 piece of dough at a time and roll it out on a floured surface till it is about 8-10 inches across and less than 1/4 inch thick. lay it on the hot griddle and cook it over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes (i don't think mine took that long). it will puff up in places or all over, and there will be some blackish-brown spots on the bottom. slide a spatula under the naan and transfer it to the oven, directly onto the rack, for a minute or two, just till it finishes puffing up into a balloon and begins to color lightly on top. remove naan from the oven and brush it lightly with melted butter if you like. continue this way with all the dough, stacking the breads into a napkin-lined basket. serve the breads hot, fresh from the oven, or let them cool and wrap them up. to reheat, wrap them in aluminum foil, in packets of 4 or 5 breads and put them in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes."
"directions grate khoya and keep aside. combine carrots and milk in a large heavy based pan. bring to a boil. lower the heat and cook the carrots, stirring constantly, until all the milk dries up. pour ghee into the carrots. add khoya. saute for a few minutes. add sugar. continue to cook and stir the carrot mixture till it dries. remove from heat when still moist. stir in the saffron, cardamom powder and almonds, reserving a few for garnish along with silver foil. reheat carrot halwa just before serving with a little milk. if not serving immediately, refrigerate carrot halwa and re-heat and serve when desired. handy hint: if u dont have khoya, use 1 cup whole milk powder mixed with 1 tsp ghee and 1-2 tbsp water to get a dough like consistency. this makes 100gms of khoya."
"directions to make the batter: soak the lentils in 250ml (9fl oz) of the measured water for about ?1 hour, until they absorb it all. transfer the lentils to a blender and add the ginger, chilli, and coriander and blend until smooth. tip the paste into a bowl and stir in the salt, semolina and the remaining 350ml (12fl oz) measured water, mixing well. combine all the topping ingredients in a bowl. to cook the chilla: heat a frying pan and, once it is very hot, pour a serving-spoonful of the batter into the pan and spread it into a 13–15-cm (5–6-inch) circle. top with 1 tablespoon of the topping mixture and drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the batter. cook over medium heat for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown on the underside, then turn the chilla over and cook for a further 2 minutes, until golden brown on both sides. repeat to make 15 more. serve hot with the chutney ?of your choice. recipe courtesy of chai, chaat & chutney by chetna makan. get the book here: https://www.amazon.com/chai-chaat-chutney-journey-through/dp/1784722871/."

"directions heat oil over medium-high heat, and add cinnamon, cardamom and cloves. when the aroma is released, reduce heat, and add the onion and garlic, cook until onion is softened. add chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, then add salt, ground cinnamon, ground cardamom, ground cloves and hot pepper. mix well so the spices cover the chicken. add tomato sauce and water, cover and cook for 10 minutes. add buttermilk, ground cumin and coriander, cover and cook for 5 minutes. serve with rice or naan bread."
directions combine all ingredients in a blender. process about 1 minute or until smooth.
"directions put flour in a mixing bowl. add gramflour. mix well. add yogurt and water. mix well, using a spoon, ensuring that no lumps remain. mix to obtain what is technically called,""ribbon consistency"". (ribbon consistency simply requires you to mix for about 5-7 minutes, really well, so that when the mixture is dropped from the mixing spoon into the mixing bowl, it should fall like a ribbon. don't let the term scare you, it's pretty easy, you just got to). add a pinch of baking soda. at this point, this mixture (batter) can be refrigerated if you are planning on making the jalebis later. if you plan to make the jalebis instantly, put the mixture in a jalebi bottle (you get these bottles to make jalebis in the market). if you dont have a jalebi bottle, you can use an empty well-washed and thoroughly clean, tomato ketchup bottle. if you got an icing bag, use that. i used the icing bag with the""star"" nozzle attachment. you may experiment with the other nozzles, if you wish, but please dont, in any circumstances, try using the""writing"" nozzle attachment, because if you do so, the jalebis that you'll be making will be the thinnest on the face of the planet,lol. heat oil on low-medium flame in a frying pan. meanwhile, spoon the above prepared batter in the icing bag fitted with the star nozzle/jalebi bottle/ tomato ketchup bottle. drop the batter by squeezing the bottle/icing bag, into the hot oil, in concentric circular motion to make the jalebis. lightly brown on either side. repeat until all the batter is used up. on low flame heat the pre-prepared sugar-water syrup (known in hindi as""chashni""). add few threads of saffron to the syrup- these look really pretty on the jalebis later when you dip the latter into them. now, drain the excess oil from the jalebis. drop into the sugar-water syrup. dip well, toss well, to coat the jalebis in the syrup. drain excess syrup from the jalebis. serve immediately or serve hot if you plan to serve them later on, make sure to warm them a bit in the oven (2-3 minutes) and then serve. get ready to put on your apron and go make more of these because they'll vanish before you know! don't blame me if you get addicted to these like my dad."
"directions in a large bowl, stir together well the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream, and optional other flavor. pour into popsicle molds, indian stainless steel kulfi molds, or even a small bowl. freeze overnight. remove from the molds by resting their bottoms very briefly in warm to hot water (if you do this for too long you'll have a gooey mess!)."
"directions soak sugar in 1/2 litre of the water used. set aside. soak remaining ingredients in 2 cups of remaining water. set aside. allow all soaked items to stand for at least 2 hours. grind all soaked ingredients to a very fine paste. (not sugar) in a processor or blender. place a double layer of cheesecloth or a coffee filter over/in a strainer and set over a large container/pitcher. press through muslin with the back of a spoon, extracting as much liquid as possible. add remaining water, a little at a time to extract more of the nut liquid. pour back some of the extract and press, repress.  do this a number of times to extract as much flavour out of the nut paste as possible. mix well. chill for atleast 2 hours before serving.  you may need to give the drink a stir before pouring. to serve, sprinkle some rose petals over each serving (optional). note:  do not discard the nut paste - it is excellent used in making korma-type curries."
"directions melt the butter over low heat. stir in sugars. add the milk and bring to a boil gradually over medium heat. lower the flame and add the powdered milk slowly, stirring to work out all the lumps. if you're adding nuts, mix them in once the lumps are smoothed out. cook on medium heat for approximately 4-5 minutes, until nice and thick. butter a 9x13 inch cake pan and pour mixture into pan, spread evenly. cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge to set - the girls stick it in the freezer so they don't have to wait so long :). once set, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. keep refrigerated and covered with plastic wrap. one hour of prep time is actual cooling time. makes approximately 60 small squares."
"directions sift and pick through the puffed rice, discard discolored pieces. dry roast the puffed rice until it is toasty but not colored. spread over a paper towel to allow moisture to wick away. let it cool. heat the oil in a large wok. add cumin seeds, ginger and curry leaves. stir vigorously to season the oil well, reduce the heat. add dried red chilies, asafetida powder and turmeric powder; stir vigorously to avoid burning. add the raisins and peanuts, allow them to cook. as the peanuts begin to roast, add the salt, sugar and lime juice; turn off the heat. while the oil and spices are still hot, add the cooled toasted puffed rice and sev in small batches. toss with two flat spatulas with each addition until all the rice is mixed inches return the wok to a medium-low heat and toss this mixture quickly. remove from heat. serve hot or allow to cool and store it in an airtight container for up to four weeks."
"directions put the oil in a thick bottom pan. add water and sugar. stir and bring to a boil. remove from heat immediately. let it stand until it is lukewarm. fold in the flour adding a little at a time. knead well. heat oil in a deep frying pan. divide the dough into lemon sized balls and roll out with a rolling pin. you should not be able to see the surface you are rolling it on through the dough. using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife cut into strips at an angle. turn the surface 90 degrees and cut diagonally to form diamonds. if you don't cut at an angle you will get squares, diamonds look better. deep fry in the oil until golden brown. store in a air tight container."
"directions in a small mixing bowl, stir together the yogurt and lemon juice.  add the spices, minced garlic, and chili paste, and whisk until you have a smooth, thick marinade. put 6 pieces of the chicken in each of two zip-lock bags, and add 1/2 the marinade to each bag.  zip closed and knead the bags until the chicken is well-coated with marinade.  open bags slightly, squeeze out most of the air, and zip closed again.  refrigerate 12-24 hours.  if serving this for dinner, i usually make the marinade and start the chicken soaking the evening before. turn the bags and knead the marinating chicken once or twice while it's in the refrigerator. when you are ready to cook, take the chicken out of the refrigerator, line a large roasting pan with foil, lay a rack over the pan so air can circulate under the roasting chicken, and pre-heat your oven to 425.  if you have a convection bake or convection roast cycle, use that. place the chicken pieces on the rack so they are not touching.  empty what is left of the marinade into a bowl or measuring cup and touch up any ""empty"" spots on the chicken pieces with the marinade. once the oven is hot, put the pan with the chicken in the oven, and leave the door closed (no peeking!).  turn the chicken pieces once after 30 minutes of cooking time, then roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly charred on the second side, but no more than 15 minutes for legs and thighs.  if you are cooking breasts, poke one with a skewer to make sure the juices run clear. now turn the oven off, and let the chicken rest in the closed oven for 20-30 minutes more (not critical, but no peeking!). remove the chicken to a warm platter, garnish with the onion rings and a few squeezes of lemon, and enjoy! see if you don't agree this is as good as any ""authentic"" tandoori chicken you've ever tried!"
directions saute onion and garlic in oil 5 minutes until onion is soft. add all other ingredients except crescent rolls. stir gently over medium heat for several minutes until well incorporated. set aside. heat oven to 375°f. open cans of crescent rolls and unroll the dough. separate into 4 rectangles and pinch the triangular perforations to seal. cut each rectangle in half crosswise to make squares (you'll have 8 squares per can of crescent rolls). you may have to coax the dough gently with your hands to make it square and to close up the perforations. spoon a heaping spoonful of filling in the center of each square and fold over to make a triangle. pinch the edges to seal. bake on cookie sheets sprayed with pam for 12-15 minutes until golden. cool slightly on rack. serve warm with honey dipping sauce. mix sauce well in small bowl.
"directions heat cumin seeds and mustard seed in hot dry skillet over high heat, swirling pan, until seeds start to pop. reduce heat to medium; add onions, chilies, and add a small amount of water; cook until onion is tender, adding more water as necessary to prevent sticking. add potatoes, ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt (to taste), and cayenne pepper, stirring to mix well. add 2/3 cup water, cover, reduce heat and cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until spices are absorbed and potatoes are tender. add a small amount of water at a time if all liquid evaporates. fold in cilantro just before serving."

"directions put flour and salt in a bowl. add water a cup at a time, kneading. when kneading, make your hand into a fist and roll your knuckles into the dough, folding edges in continuously, working in all the flour. when all the flour is kneaded into a ball, poke lots of holes into the ball of dough. pour a little oil into the dough and knead it inches. add the rest of the oil (the dough will look very oily and that's the way it should be). cover with a clean cloth and let sit for at least an hour. roll the ball in a little bit of flour so it's not sticky. divide the dough into about 15-20 balls depending on how big you want the chappatis to be. flour the counter/board. roll out each ball to about 6 inches in diameter. brush with melted butter. fold in three (like you fold a letter). now it should almost look like a long tube. take one end of that tube and fold it in to the centre and gently press it inches. take the other end of the tube and fold it over the seam. now you should have a little bundle of dough. (in other words, fold the dough into thirds one way, and then the other). flour a plate and place the bundles on them. roll each one out to about 6-8 inch diamete, flouring counter/board as needed. on a flat cast iron disc (available at indian grocery stores) or on a big frying pan (cast iron is best), heat pan, and put chappati on it. when it starts looking a bit translucent, flip it over. brush with melted butter, shuffling it around the pan quickly, then a quick flip over, a bit of melted butter (it should start puffing up into a pillow like shape). once it has small golden brown dots on both sides, take it off an put into a serving dish (cover with a clean cloth as you keep preparing the rest). you will have to adjust the heat during the whole frying process. clean off the pan with paper towels or a clean cloth in between frying each chappati. don't turn the chappatis too much, just once or twice is enough."

"directions to make ghee: put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. then reduce to low. now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. the white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. a foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. the butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. when the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. if you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot. making the scented syrup: combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. remove from heat and add rose water or essence. traditional method: use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. use a non-stick pot if you have it. boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside. powdered-milk method: combine the warm milk and ghee together. mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate. cooking the jamuns: this is the most delicate part of the operation. gentle, low heat is a must. use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth. heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees. slip in the balls, one by one. they will sink. no touching at this point. gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. after about 5 minutes they will begin to float. you will notice them getting bigger. now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning. the ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook. after about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden. remove a ball and put it in the syrup. if it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup. if it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again. let soak for 2 hours at least before serving. serve room temperature or warmed up. enjoy your gulab jamuns!"

"directions place oil in a medium sauce pan, break the vermicelli into inch-long pieces (i find it easy to lay on a chopping board & slice with a large chefs knife) and add to the pan. cook the vermicelli over a medium heat, stirring occasionally. when the vermicelli has browned to a walnut colour -  about 5 minutes, add the milk and almonds. gently bash the cardamom pods with a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy pan to release the seeds. add the seeds to the cooking pan & add the sugar. cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes over medium heat. the vermicelli will begin to soak up the milk. check every 5 minutes to see how much milk has been absorbed & be careful to stir occasionally. when the milk is almost completely absorbed, turn the heat as low as will go & cook with the lid off for around 10 minutes or until the noodles are separated. serve warm in small bowls topped with the pistachios. to make this a creamy dessert, you can also spoon over a little single cream or evaporated milk! (if using the mixed fruit & nut add half of it at the time when the almonds are added & the remainder to decorate like the pistachios)."
