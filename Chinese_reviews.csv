"basically all ingredients i use, except for egg. just one pound of pork should never have all of that garlic! i love garlic but that's too, too much! a couple of tbsp would be about another 3-4 cloves added to the five. might as well call them ""garlic dumplings"". one bunch of scallions is sufficient. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jane s. reply"

"i'd be very concerned with using the reserved marinade to baste. you were soaking raw pork in the marinade and then continuing to apply that to your ribs? from a health viewpoint, do this only if you continue to cook the ribs an adequate amount of time after each basting! otherwise, you're contaminating your cooked ribs with raw pork juice. many times i boil the leftover marinade before serving it at the table. this is another option. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal motiger1 reply 7 see 1 reply awesome ribs. followed the recipe exactly. don’t think i’d change a thing icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal oku1984 reply 3 excellent flavor. will be a permanent ""go to"" recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephen f. reply 2 great flavor! followed directions. used all natural everything, straight down the list. organic where i could. and i ditched the food coloring. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal moonwolf reply"
"the family loved it! next time i am doubling the recipe. they gobbled it up fast and wanted more. i do not have a nonstick but my cast iron pan worked beautifully with charring the eggplant. i put the oil on after it was charred. since i did not have the chili oil, i added some splashes of sriracha to the sauce as it was thickening. since we are big garlic lovers,i added more cloves and because i love chinese five spice, i added a heaping teaspoon. lovely! my son is over the moon. thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal anonymous reply 4 the entire family really enjoyed this. i paired it with spaghetti squash and seared scallops. what a delicious side dish. i will definitely make this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal june.robert.9999 reply 2"
excellent! best general tso recipe i've made. the only edit i will make next time is to substitute the soy sauce for bragg liquid aminos or coconut aminos for less sodium. i hope the taste is as good. i couldn't stop eating this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal food3156 reply the taste was on point but how can i keep the crispiness after tossing in sauce? the only ones that remained crispy were the ones i burned ???? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sara o. reply see 2 replies

"i toasted my seasame seeds and only added half to the marinade and used the other half to sprinkle over the plated dish.  i used 2 baby bok choy for 3 of us.  the only change i would make would be to divide the marinade and add stalks to one half and the leaf to the other and cook the stems for 2 minutes and then add the leaf for a minute for though the stems were nice and crispy the leaf was overdone for us but still the taste was very good. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal i'mpat reply 10 i love bok choy and this was exactly what i was looking for!!!! i'm also crazy about very hot food so i used chili sesame oil and instead of soy sauce and brown sugar, i used hoisin sauce.. made it last night and i'm making it again tonight!! yummy!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal spatula licker reply 3 an ideal side! we like everything about this the way i prepared it as i did make one minor change. the change i made was to toss the stems in one bowl and the leave in a second so as both the stems and leaves would be well sauced and could be cooked evenly by first putting in the stems in the pan for a few minutes and when almost done added the leaves, resulting in tender stems and bright lightly cooked leaves. i did not and would not change the ingredients as the flavors were perfect. this is going into my will make again book, thanks for the post. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal debbwl reply 2 i did not change a thing! so simple and tasty. i did saute for only 8 minutes. the bok choy was still a little crunchy but that is how i like it. the leafy part was nicely limp but not mushy. oops - my bad. i do not have canola oil. i used sesame oil. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal caddy lady reply 1 absolutely delicious! i added a little sesame oil to the base recipe, and just dumped the whole thing a lidded skillet and let it braise for 10 minutes or so. yum yum yum! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal drgaellon reply 1"

"this recipe was the closest to what i've eaten at chinese restaurants.  what gave it its most genuine chinese restaurant quality, was the breaded pork.  

i added a little baking soda to the batter, and deep fried the pieces of battered pork, which made it very authentic.  before i deep-fried the pork, i baked the pieces in the oven on a large cookie sheet for about 20 minutes, so they were actually already done all the way through.  

the deep-frying took very little time, and they came out golden brown.  if i hadn't pre-baked, they may have been a little undercooked inside.  i also used rice vinegar, instead of white vinegar, because it's been sitting in my cabinet for months, and i wanted to use it.  i used about a quarter cup less, because it was all the rice vinegar i had, but i didn't need to add any white vinegar, because it turned out just perfect.  i also sauteed my vegetables in a separate sautee pan.  

even though it sounds like i changed this recipe a lot, i'm sure if i had followed it to the letter, it would have been excellent too.  

the chinese restaurant version i am used to has a red sweet and sour sauce, and this is not red, but it is very good!  if you want red, go buy it, unless you know how they make that stuff.  i would love to know.  but this sauce is excellent.  


the batter is an excellent recipe for batter.  i plan on using it for onion rings and mushrooms too!  thanks for posting!  

by the way...this recipe was about the only one without stars posted behind it, and i chose it anyway, because of the batter, which was what i was looking for to mimic the chinese restaurant's version.  i'm glad i can give it the credit it's due - now it will have 5 stars.  thanks again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal h. cato reply 10 see 1 reply oh boy, this was excellent and as good or better than the sweet and sour pork i have had in restaurants. the pork was tender with a wonderful battered crust. i threw in some onion rings and mushrooms. the sauce was a perfect blend of ingredients. thanks barbarak, for sharing this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ratherbeswimmin reply 3 i substituted almond meal for the flour, rice wine vinegar for the white and at the end added some sweet chili sauce for the red!  yummo!  this is the same recipe from my old betty crocker cookbook.  try it, yur sure to like it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sunny day reply 2 hey there-this is the recipe for sweet and sour pork i've been waiting for.  the sauce is a perfect balance of vinegar/sugar/juice.  the veggies were great-tender crisp.  i did add 1 onion sliced, and the pork came out just right, a little juicy with a nice crust.

"i substituted the water with fresh squeezed orange juice, and added orange zest.  it was fantastic.  very quick and easy.  my seven year old daughter said, ""mom, this is pretty grown up food, but i really like it."" :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal k8t5091 reply 27 tried this recipe for dinner tonight over jasmine rice and it was wonderful!  i scaled it down for just one serving though.  i did modify a few things.  the first thing i changed was the amount of soy sauce.  when i scaled my recipe for 1 serving the recipe calls for 1/8 a cup (two tablespoons) soy sauce.  that is over 100% of the recommended daily sodium intake, so i cut that in half.  my other modifications were adding a splash of cider vinegar and a splash of rice vinegar.  i felt the sauce needed a tinge of tang and i think that adding these to my sauce really payed off in my final product.  the spice level with the ginger and crushed red pepper were in my opinion perfection!  it had just a small bit of spice in the aftertaste which is what i like in my chinese food.  this was easy and delicious! using a 4oz chicken breast and putting this all over rice i calculated was only 430 calories, not to mention free of processed sugars or any nasty food additives.  cook this recipe up, you wont regret it!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chrisryanfox reply 19 i love it!  a chinese meal i can make for my hubby without all the mess of frying!  i added about 3 tsp of minced garlic as suggested by others and doubled the sauce.  i also ended up not having enough honey so i used part honey/part brown sugar and it worked out fine. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal run for your life reply 13 this is my second time making this recipe this month-- it is fantastic!!  quick, simple, and delicious.  i added some broccoli and onions and served it with steamed rice.  one recommendation i have is if your sesame seeds are not toasted, place them in a dry, non-stick skillet and toast them just until they are golden (it only takes a few minutes).  i never realized that you actually need to toast sesame seeds to release the oils and flavor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal quinn17 reply 12 this was really tasty.  i cooked it last night and we devoured it.  and it was so simple and easy to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michelle williams reply 10"
"i had read all the reviews before making this and listened to doubling of the sauce and i am so glad i did.  this was the most delicious general tso i have had..it was the perfect blend of flavors. not too sweet but sweet enough, spicy hot but not overly and not salty at all. i didn't find a problem with any of it.  i followed the recipe but as i said i doubled the sauce, i did add in some spring onions, a little garlic and fresh ginger and sprinkled some toasted sesame over the cooked dish. after i did the second stage cooking  i took the chicken out of the pan and kept warm and then cooked the sauce till it caramelized then re-added the chicken and mixed then served. this worked out perfectly, with the chicken having a nice crispiness to it. i give this recipe high praises and will do this restaurant quality recipe again. but i too will definitely recommend to anyone making it to double the sauce minimum.  can't wait till i make it again, i served mine with some spring rolls i had made, perfect for a lunch. thanks kirstin for adopting this recipe and to keep sharing it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frenchbunny reply 17 this is the best general tso recipe out there!!!  the taste was marvelous!  it tastes so much better than a buffet or what not.  i mad a few adjustments though.  i used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs.(highly recommended)  and i didn’t have any chili pods so i substituted dried red peppers (like the stuff you put on pizza).  it turned out beautiful!  it was very easy to make as well.  this was the first time i’ve made it and i had absolutely no trouble.  if you love general tso chicken you’ve got to try this!!!
mean chef you’re the king! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal puckhead reply 14 been making this for eight years.  nice you ""adopted"" this recipe so others could enjoy it.  i use 1 1/2 lbs of bite-sized chicken breasts.  i quadruple the sauce but only use 4 tsps of cornstarch.  i also add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  instead of chili pods, put 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes in the sauce.  when pressed for time, i've done almost all of the steps early in the day or day before.  after putting chicken in egg/cornstarch mix, cover and refrigerate.  or after first fry i refrigerated the chicken, as recipe states.  same for the sauce.  chicken will get crispy when doing the second stage frying.  i've even cooked the broccoli and rice and refrigerated them.  while frying the chicken, the broccoli & rice are microwaved.  doing it this way, i have dinner ready in 30 minutes.  i serve the broccoli over the rice, then the chicken. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal spagetts reply 7 the taste was great. i wasn't sure what type of chile pods to use, so i just picked up the dried new mexico chiles. i liked it a lot. now i don't have to go out for chinese with this recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal elizabeth fullerton reply 6 this general's chicken was the best i've ever had, and i made it! i did substite boneless, skinless chicken breast for the chicken thighs, but otherwise followed it to the letter.  i've made serveral versions of this recipe, and this is by far the best. don't be intimidated by this recipe, it really is fairly easy to put together, and you won't be disappointed! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bratty reply 4"

"cooking gluten free often means making what you need from scratch to avoid contaminants. i used trusted ingredients from my pantry to put this recipe together and could rest easy knowing the dish i prepared was truly gluten free. the side benefit to making your own homemade condiments, etc, is avoiding preservatives or other undesirable ingredients such as msg. i really appreciate this recipe. it was terrific! one thing i would suggest is mixing the peanut butter and honey together well first, then slowly incorporating the soy sauce, oil and remaining ingredients. i threw them all together as directed and found that it took lots of elbow grease with the whisk to get the peanut butter to incorporate with everything else. when i make this recipe, i double the ingredients and freeze the extra in ice cube trays, to always have some ready to go. most trays hold 1 tb in each compartment, making it super easy to measure out. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal madash reply 9 see 1 reply this was surprisingly good!! i didn't realize it would be so much better than store-bought. really loved the noodles that i made with it. will no longer buy hoisin after having this! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal limeandspoontt reply 6 i have to be very careful with ingredients due to food allergies and fussy palates, while this recipe will suit my purpose i find it odd that when you offer a ""home made"" recipe it still includes a commercial product, the chinese hot sauce. i had to go back another step to see what was in that and make that as well. in my opinion a home made recipe should be basic ingredients, or am i being too fussy here. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal alien i. reply 5 see 6 replies this is delicious! way better than store bought, and without all the crappy ingredients, like corn syrup. i’ve thought about buying at the store a number of times but didn’t want the processed ingredients. i didn’t know it was so easy to make! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal anonymous reply 4 i made it because in the time of covid 19, there wasn't any at my grocery store. i thought it was delicious, and very easy to make. i had all the ingredients at home. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal teri6766 reply 4"
"hello nona,<br/><br/>i often make mapo tofu chinese style and have posted within my ""recipes"" at zaar/food.com my version of this dish.  however, i learned a few things by making your recipe; like pre-cooking the tofu in salt water, so it will not break apart easily. i also have to say that i did not follow this recipe exactly (sorry to say, but it has to be a 5 star one) and used ingredients which i already had on hand.  i used ground chicken, sichuan spicy noodle sauce (fermented soybeans, chili), chili paste with garlic, added some garlic cloves, spring scallions, fermented black beans (more then the recipe called for)...and harveys bristol cream. the spicy flavors and taste was excellent and surely was a 5 star meal !  finally, if you are looking for a mapo tofu which is a nice combination of japanese-chinese flavors, make sure you follow the ingredients listed... for a great recipe! <br/>p.s.  i liked this recipe so much that i made it again the next day and also added some shrimps to the dish! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal skippersy reply 1 haven't had a chance to try this one yet, but i'm tucking it away for later.  the ingredients are authentic, and the picture looks just like mapo doufu ought to look. i'm sure this one is going to be a keeper. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kate s. reply 1 i too think a great deal of chef chen and did of his father as well. i am under the weather with a sinus infection and always go for this or thai when i am ill. this is a fiercely fiery dish but addictive and always just what the doctor ordered! i love this recipe and i swear i recover more quickly. thanks for posting; nice to see this here!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal hajar elizabeth reply 1 wish i could give this 10 stars - the flavor is incredible! i knew it would be since i like anything with fermented black beans, but it's extra good combined with the garlic chives, chilis and two bean sauces. the spicy flavor, combined with the small amount of meat, flavors the tofu perfectly and will convert people who aren't huge tofu fans to love it. i followed the recipe exactly except substituting peanut oil for the vegetable oil. i was excited to learn the technique of cooking the tofu in water first, which worked great! our only wish was that we had more sauce. to serve six people with rice, i'd try doubling the sauce ingredients and also reducing the final cooking time to 2-3 minutes. this dish is very special as we used garlic chives planted and grown by my next door neighbor peter who passed away on june 29. he was the executive chef of the buena vista hotel and always the most generous person, giving us delicious food and sharing herbs from his garden. he was an extraordinary person and this is an extraordinary dish - do try it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flkeysjen reply 1 this is very good! i subbed a red pepper and a can of water chestnuts for the meat to make this vegetarian. i also used half the oil, less chili, and used more brown bean sauce in lieu of the black beans, as i don't care for them. it had more sauce than the last ma po tofu dish i made, so i liked that. i used a final simmering time of 2 minutes, and the sauce was generous, but the two of us ate almost all of this with brown rice, so feeding 6 might be if you are making this along with other dishes. the flavor of the brown bean in this sauce make this a yummy dish! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal maito reply"

"here's a little tip for making crab rangoon: make sure you squeeze out all the air before sealing the wonton. if you don't a huge bubble will form when they're deep fried causing them to pop open. there are 2 bad things that occur when that happens: the filling gets very greasy; and you get very burned with spatters of hot oil. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tgobbi reply 35 we made these for 20 people,during the holidays.they were wonderful.everyone complimented them.i love them at chinese restaurants,now i can make my own. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal divinemom5 reply 21 this recipe is excellent. i did make a mistake because i made them and froze them without cooking first. tonight, i took them out to defrost them and they did not want to seperate. however, the taste is so good. at the oriental restaurants when i have this dish, it is usually very pastey, very thick. this recipe is light and tasty. i will make this again. we had this and geosa and that was our friday night pizza substitute this week. glad we left the pizza at the store. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal barbarak reply 10 see 1 reply thank you for posting this recipe! these are so easy to make and taste like they came from a restaurant! this is one of my new favorites!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lily1 reply 10 made this for the first time last saturday while my mother-in-law was there.  she had so much fun helping me make these (she called them packages).  i'm not a good cook, and everyone at the party i took them too, ranted and raved about them!  i made a small substitution on the ginger.  i used ground instead of fresh...and i used shrimp instead of crab, but they tasted great!  thanks for the posting!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bean5286 reply 6"

"great ! this recipe tasted exactly like what i grew up eating (in a half chinese family).<br/><br/>a few small changes:<br/><br/>1) i used natural pork loin filets, approximately 1.5 lbs<br/>2) i dry roasted the pork after 36 hours of marinade: 30 minutes at 350 degrees, followed by 5 minutes each side with the broiler<br/>3) the glaze i used (and basted each side of the fillets with) consisted of simply honey and 1/4 c the original marinade icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rebecca m. reply 3 i was craving some roast pork lo mein and the char siu that was at the market didn't appeal to me so i gave your recipe a whirl. i bought my  pork at my local asian market and had all the other ingredients on hand.   i just pulled this out of the oven and had to try a piece - it is delicious! now i have plenty to add to my other dishes that i like to make. thanks for sharing your recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nancy f. reply 1 amazing!!!  i don't think there are words to describe how tender & delicious this pork was.  made as directed, except i used a tenderloin (grocery store did not have a shoulder/butt at the time).  wow.  the water bath was great for keeping the meat moist.  oh, i forgot to cut the tenderloin into strips before marinating so i did it right before cooking, dunked them in the marinade & then put them on the broiler pan.  every ingredient that went into this marinade played a part in creating a well-balanced, subtle yet very flavorful meat.  the glaze was excellent also.  my family went crazy over this recipe & even picky dd ate it!  i served it with recipe #343016 & recipe #382595.  thank you so much for sharing this recipe, icedcacti!  it's going into the ""definitely make again"" file!  made for fall 2009 pick a chef. http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=310505&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tinkerbell reply 1 loved all the flavor on the meat.  i will cook a little less next time but was so good.  served with fried rice.  wish i would have doubled the recipe.  wanted more for leftover to make chinese buns. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal adopt a greyhound reply made this for dinner this past week-end and family thought it was really good.  meat was very tender and had nice flavor.  will make again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal niteflyer reply"

"thank you for the recipe! this was really good and easy to follow. i used garlic powder instead of mincing garlic and will try using a garlic press to squeeze out the ginger juice next time instead of mincing ginger. i also used minced pork instead of the chicken. the sesame oil and white pepper at the end is a very good touch and definately enhances flavor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dou sa bao reply 1 i love congee (jook) and being thai i have fond memories of eating many bowls of this at my grandmother's house in thailand for breakfast.  i had some leftover jasmine rice in the fridge ( maybe about 1/4 c cooked?) and just added 2 cups of water to it and let it simmer on the stove.  i added some crumbled cooked pork i had in the freezer, a clove of garlic, and grated some ginger into it ( i froze the ginger first...so easy to grate).  i did not add the oyster sauce or soy but instead used nam pla ( fish sauce).  i also forgot about the mushrooms, but usually i prepare them without.  i did have to add additional water after simmering it for 25 minutes... but it turned out so creamy and smooth and fragrant.  right before serving, i dropped in one whole egg and gave it a swirl... that is how i always had it... try it!  it's sooooo good that way!  thanks for posting a true asian comfort food! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal atlfitgirl reply 1 i've never had congee before, but i saw some show on pbs talking about it, so my interest was piqued and i was delighted to find your recipe for easy rice congee!  i made this with brown rice (we don't eat white rice), so it turned out a fairly unattractive grayish color, but tasty nonetheless!   i used 3 cups water and did not find that i needed any more using the stovetop method.  i simmered for about an hour and a half or so, until nice and creamy but still with a nice texture.  i only used one x-large chicken breast- i wasn't entirely sure what was meant by 2 pieces chicken breast.   otherwise, followed the recipe- very nice chickeny mushroomy flavor with an interesting texture.  i mean- this is, undeniably, gruel, so if you're not up for that i wouldn't recommend this.  but this was a very nice rainy night supper.  we served with oney roasted squash rings #72722 on the side.  i did find this a tad bland, even with the garnishes.  i added a smidge of zhoug #57689 to mine for a little flavor/heat.  next time i would add some other vegetables- maybe some julienned carrots or some onion or something and perhaps add the mushrooms later in the cooking process because they got kind of disintegrated... so did the chicken, by the way- i sliced them very thin and they broke up a lot into small chunks.  let me mention that i selected this (officially, at least, its been in my cookbook for a while) for pick your chef nov 1-nov 29 2004.  anyway, this was a good supper!  thanks for a nice introduction to congee! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal roosie reply 1 this made my whole house smell fantasic. all my friends and family loved it, and it's also super easy to prepare and switch up to fit your needs. that's a win-win!! there's nothing i would change for this recipe; thank you for sharing it with everybody. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal seth l. reply loved how easy this was! i made congee for myself because i have the cold. i did a vegetarian version. the ginger is the best part of this recipe! i didn't add soy sauce but it tasted great anyway! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal brenda l. reply"

i add 2 spring onions, green part only, to the ginger sauce because that is how it is served in most restos.

i also add 1 tablespoon of chinese rice wine to the sauce for chicken.

if you have an asian grocery near you, check out their singapore hainanese chicken rice packet by asian home gourmet.  i add this spice paste to the rice which makes the rice to-die-for... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sueisabel reply this was fantastic, especially the sauce for the chicken.  i can't rate the ginger sauce, as we didn't make it, but it sounds good.  we had a jar of singapore hainanese chicken sauce from the chinese supermarket (which we thinhk is very authentic) so didn't make that sauce either, but the star was the soy/sesame/garlic sauce - outstanding yet so simple.  out of the 5 places we had chicken rice in singapore and malacca, this tasted the best, apart from one place in malacca.  the only thing i did differently was to add to the poaching liquor soy sauce instead of salt and a few dried chilies.  it was so simple, quick and most of all delicious, we will be making this again and again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bridget c reply"
"i want to piggyback on gscook's comments, which were very helpful. i had the most success when i made the cookies little larger than 3"" (a tablespoon amount usually did the trick) and then used a 3' wide wine glass and trimmed the cookie after its 6 minute cycle. flipping them over, folding all went very well as the crisp parts were now removed. i cooked two at a time since i needed time to trim.
i placed the completed cookies back in the oven for 5 minutes at 300 to sort of crisp them up. 
i took eight attempts to net five cookies, and then i was getting two a cycle. very yummy, and i would definitely try this again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal thomas-mail reply 3 for chinese night i made these for fun...i cant say it was a complete disaster, but i learned a few things about making fortune cookies. these spread alot in the oven. so, after the first batch i didnt spread them as thin..if they dont completely harden you can place them back in the muffin pan in a warm oven to harden up till crisp,but not to hot a oven as they will completely soften again and loose there shape..individually wrap in press and seal and store in ziploc till serving time..also,my problem with all the cookies was the messages stick to the cookies,eliminating the fun,reason way i made them. next time i will place the message on the cooked side and fold over.but the kids were impressed with the idea anyways and they did look like fortune cookies and what they could eat of the cookie and not paper tasted good, everyone liked the flavor..would i make these again? time will tell...but i know i have to give it another try... . icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal potluck reply 3 i am, with some trepidation, giving this 5 stars.  the final half of my second batch finaly turned out looking like fortune cookies!  the first batch did not turn out at all.  the batter had the consistency of a mousse which i thought odd.  i beat the egg whites until light and fluffy but not stiff, then had to beat the bejeebitz out of it after i added the sugar to get it anywhere near stiff.  the cookies were too spongy in the middle... and too thick.  they did not fold at all but merely broke and crumbled.  then i added some water and tried again... again no luck.  i tried what another reviewer did and attempted to make them on a giddle like a pancake... that really didn't work!  but each disasterous attempt to bake and fold ended up in my mouth and boy were these tasty so i decided to try another batch before completely giving up.  this time, i walked away from the beater when beating the whites and when i returned they were stiff (oops).  i added the sugar and only had to blend it in since it was already stiff!  then when i put the remaining ingredients in, it miraculously turned into a batter rather than a mousse!  these spread easily into a nice thin circle.  i baked them for 5 and a half to six minutes (at 350) and they still weren't golden on the edges, but one batch that did get golden also didn't fold too well so i took them out and they folded easily.  about halfway through i was becoming an expert folder and my little wonders looked like the real thing!  one note... they look better if you flip them over before folding so that the side that was down on the baking sheet is on the inside of the folded cookie.  then you get the nice smooth top of the cookie on the outside.  for ease i'd rate this recipe a 2... (expect at least one batch of trial and error) but the taste is so awesome, i can't help but give it a five.  now that i have the hang of it, i'm dreaming up creative ways to use these gems!  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gscook reply 2 they cracked a little, but that was okay. they tasted delicious, but 1/2 tsp of the lemon extract was like eating a lemon fortune cookie. if you take out the lemon extract, use another 1/2 tsp of maple extract, they are delicious! great taste! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal coratidwella7a5 reply 1 came out great! easy to follow recipe and short ingredients list. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kristynadaniels89 reply 1"
