"directions put the milk, yeast, egg and 1 cup of the flour in the bowl of a heavy duty mixer. mix the ingredients together with a rubber spatula, mixing just until everything is blended. sprinkle over the remaining cup of flour to cover the sponge. set the sponge aside to rest uncovered for 30-40 minutes. after this resting time, the flour coating will crack, your indication that everything is moving along properly. add the sugar, salt, eggs, and 1 cup of the flour to the sponge. set in the mixer, attach the dough hook, and mix on low speed for a minute or two, just until the ingredients look as if they are about to come together. still mixing, sprinkle in 1/2 cup more flour. when the flour is incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about 15 minutes, stopping to scrape down the hook and bowl as needed. during this mixing period, the dough should come together, wrap itself around the hook and slap the sides of the bowl. in order to incorporate the butter into the dough, you must work the butter until it is the same consistency as the dough. you can bash the butter into submission with a rolling pin or give it kinder and gentler handling by using a dough scraper to smear it bit by bit across a smooth work surface. when it is ready, the butter will be smooth, soft, and still cool- not warm, oily or greasy. with the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time. this is the point at which you'll think you've made a huge mistake, because the dough that you worked so hard to make smooth will fall apart- don't worry, don't panic- carry on. when all of the butter has been added, raise the mixer speed to medium-high for a minute, then reduce the speed to medium and beat the dough for about 5 minutes, or until you once again hear the dough slapping against the sides of the bowl. clean the sides of the bowl frequently as you work; if it looks as though the dough is not coming together after 2-3 minutes, add up to 1 tablespoon more flour. when you're finished, the dough should feel somewhat cool. it will be soft and sill sticky and may cling slightly to the sides and bottom of the bowl. first rise: transfer the dough to a very large buttered bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 2- 2 1/2 hours. second rise and chill: deflate the dough by placing your fingers under it, lifting a section of dough, and then letting it fall back into the bowl. work your way around the circumference of the dough, lifting and releasing. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight, or for at least 4-6 hours, during which time it will continue to rise and may double in size again. after this long chill, the dough is ready to use in any brioche recipe. storing: if you are not going to use or bake the dough after it's second rise, deflate it, wrap it airtight, and store it in the freezer. the dough can remain frozen for up to a month. thaw the dough, still wrapped, in the refrigerator overnight and use it directly from the refrigerator. to bake in loaves: divide the dough into thirds. divide each section into 6 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball on a lightly floured work-surface. place the balls side-by-side in a greased loaf pan so that you have 3 short rows, each with two balls of dough. do the same with the other two pieces of brioche dough. cover the pans with plastic and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 hours, or until doubled in size. preheat the oven to 375°f. lightly brush each loaf with egg wash, taking care not to let the glaze dribble into the pan (it will impair the dough's rise in the oven). use the ends of a pair of very sharp scissors to snip a cross in each ball of dough. bake the loaves for about 30 minutes, or until an instant read thermometer reads 200°f. cool to room temperature on a rack. note: you could also use this dough to make the very finest sticky-buns you've ever eaten in your entire life, or you can press it out in a deep dish pizza pan, cover it with cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar, the put fruit slices or berries over it for a very upscale""fruit pizza""."

"directions preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. combine the butter, parsley, shallots, garlic, and brandy in a bowl and blend well. place a snail in each shell and fill the cavity with the seasoned butter.  (if you do not have shells, you can use escargot baking dishes - this is actually how i prefer to make them.  most of such dishes hold 6 escargot apiece.). place on a baking pan and bake for twelve minutes. serve hot, as an appetizer, on individual snail dishes - or on small folded napkins on plates, to keep the shells from sliding about.  also, small silver forks to easily eat them with are a good idea. make sure to have plenty of good bread alongside, to mop up the delicious butter sauce!  :). also good with a bit of parmesan sprinkled on top of each."
"directions make vanilla pastry cream: in 2 quart saucepan, combine sugar, flour and salt; stir in milk. over medium heat, cook, stirring until mixture thickens and boils, about 10 minutes. boil 1 minute. in a small bowl with fork, beat 6 egg yolks slightly. beat small amount of heated milk mixture into yolks. slowly pour egg mixture back into milk mixture, stirring. cook over medium low heat, stirring till mixture thickens and coats spoon well, about 8 minutes (do not boil). to check thickness, lift metal spoon from mixture and hold up 15 seconds - spoon should not show through mixture. remove from heat; stir in vanilla. at this point i usually put this custard through a strainer to get out any lumpy cooked egg pieces. cover surface with plastic wrap, and chill well, about 2 hours. when custard is cool, in a small bowl with mixer at medium speed, beat heavy/whipping cream till stiff peaks form. with a rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream into custard. puffs: spray 1 or 2 large cookie sheets with nonstick spray.  heat oven to 375. in 2 qt saucepan over medium heat, heat butter, water and salt till butter mixture boils. remove from heat. add flour all at once.  with a wooden spoon, vigorously stir until mixture forms a ball and leaves sides of pan. add eggs to the flour mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition, till smooth. cool mixture slightly. using a large spoon and rubber spatula, drop batter onto cookie sheets int 12 large mounds, 3 inches apart, swirling the top of each. (for eclairs, instead of mounds, spread the choux paste into 5"" by 3/4"" rectangles). bake 50 minutes (this is what the original recipe says - however, i never bake them that long - more like 35 minutes - go by your own oven - if they're looking puffed and browned and dry, they're probably done). at this point, remove from oven, cut a small slit in the side of each puff and return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. turn off oven and let dry for 5-10 minutes (i don't usually do this and it doesn't seem to matter too much). when puffs are cool, slice top off of each - there will probably be some webby looking soft dough inside - carefully pull this out to make it hollow. fill each shell with the chilled pastry cream. replace top and sprinkle with powdered sugar. for eclairs: go through the same process, but top with semisweet chocolate glaze:  in saucepan, melt 2 squares semisweet chocolate and 2 t butter, stirring constantly (or heat briefly in the microwave to melt) stir in 1 cup powdered sugar and 3 t milk till smooth."
"directions preheat the oven to 400 degrees f. mix the sliced apples together with 1/2 cup of the sugar and the lemon juice in a large bowl and set aside. the lemon juice will give flavor as well as keep your apple wedges from oxidizing. melt the butter in a 12-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar evenly over the melting butter. place the apples in the skillet, flat-side down, starting from the outside and working in, slightly overlapping one another. fill in the center with the remaining apples. return the skillet to medium-low heat on the stovetop and cook until the caramel darkens in color evenly, 20 to 25 minutes. keeping your heat on medium-low will ensure that your caramel doesn't burn and cooks evenly. remove the skillet from the heat. lay the puff pastry over the skillet and simply fold the corners in to fit into the pan. bake until the crust has puffed and is golden brown, 20 minutes. let cool, making sure that it is cool enough to handle. loosen up the edges using a butter knife. place a plate or platter larger than the skillet right on top. carefully (but with gusto!) flip the tart upside-down onto the plate. if the apples stick to the skillet, carefully remove them and put them back where they belong on the tart. serve the warm tart with gelato or whipped cream."
