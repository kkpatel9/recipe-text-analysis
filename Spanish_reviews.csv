the best croquetas i've ever made and eaten! they were delicious! they reminded me of the kind i had in spain. will definitely be making these again and again. saving the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 wonderful crusty ouside with warm tasty inside.   another new experience for us using manchego cheese and serrano ham.  delicious tapas. made for zwt8. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lavender lynn reply 1
"i ate a lot of pan con tomate in spain and this is the right way to make it. rubbing the tomato into the crispy bread allows the juices and seeds to soak in perfectly, without making it soggy. it's so simple but one of the best things you'll ever eat! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 oh, a delightful, heavenly combination. i am in my glory both cooking and eating this type of food. my only big complaint for what would otherwise be a definite five star rating is the use of garlic salt. i made this bread for the base:recipe #235909, a good quality fruity spanish olive oil, fresh tomatoes (unknown variety) from the farmer's market, fresh garlic (tried to find elephant garlic but it's not available locally yet) from the farmer's market and a sprinkle of corsican salt. fresh basil ribbons' garnish (fresh from our garden!) *watch* carefully when broiling! i actually closed my eyes when i took bites. good, good food-food of the gods good! reviewed for veg tag/july. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cookgirl reply 1 i couldn't tell if i was to actually put the tomato on the bread or not, so i just went ahead and did. i actually drizzled with olive oil before toasting (oops) and sprinkled with sea salt and topped with some delicious basil! tomatoes with bread is one of the few ways i can eat tomato and i loved this so it'll be a new staple for me! made for veg*n swap 37! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sarahbeth reply"
"i've never had this dish before but i have to say that it's absolutely delicious. i can't wait to make it again. it's so flavorful and perfect for a chilly evening. it's worth the steps needed to make it the night before. loved it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 mmm... ethnic comfort food! i didn't have access to traditional beans so i used ""great northern"" beans and it was still delicious. the combo of chorizo, ham, and beans was very satisfying, and anything saffron in it is good! i served this with a spinach, walnut and manchego salad. i did not need the extra butter because our chorizo had enough fat in it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal da huz reply"
"i love gazpacho so much, especially during these hot summer days, and this one just might be the best i've ever made/eaten. the depth of flavor was incredible. super easy to make and so delicious. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 this is spot on for classic spanish ingredients but the quantities are off. also, you will never get smooth spanish gazpacho if you don't seed the tomatoes and cuke. i use plum tomatoes, cut them in half, then squeeze out the seeds: quick and easy. just spoon/scrape out the cuke seeds. if you use 2 lbs or more tomatoes just make two batches so you don't spill over your cuisinart; i just transfer first batch to the same large plastic thermos i store it in. ingredients: use a whole tablespoon of cumin, 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, 1-2 tablespoons of salt to taste (i use lime sea salt), 8 plum tomatoes, a whole english cuke, a whole onion, and a whole red or green pepper. i cut the oil in half and only use about 3 or 4 inches of baguette. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jlinsdell reply 2 see 2 replies authentic, delicious gazpacho, but no to the cumin.  best in the summer when all the ingredients are in season.  i have an old osterizer blender and it really blends the vegetables smooth.  also, i cut the olive oil in half, as i like it lighter.  this is the real deal served in spain, but i do not think they use cumin!  forget the recipes with 15 ingredients and v-8.  definitely not needed.  it is a seasonal dish, do not bother in the winter. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamma mia mamma mia reply 2 my husband and i honeymooned in spain, and had the most amazing gazpacho it a little cafe. in my very, very broken spanish, i told the waitress that my new husband now loves their gazpacho more than he loves me, which made her and the rest of the staff laugh and, in very broken english, try to give me the recipe. this is the closest recipe i've found to match that memory, and my family thanks you for it :) note to self, 1 lb of tomatoes is roughly 2.5 cups chopped, and half the recipe is all my food processor can handle before leaking badly. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lighty reply 2 i finally splurged on a vitamix… boy what a great recipe to start with. first really hot day always makes me want gazpacho. and this is always the go to recipe. it’s cool and delicious! i share it with the world because after trying many others (and to be clear… i’ve never had one i didn’t like), i have found the family favorite! thank you so much for sharing!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michelle l. reply 1"
"these were lovely. i should have chopped up onions and tomato more finely but didn't because i was a lazy butt. i let myself down, but the flavours were nice. i found it nearly too spicy for myself, but it was well enjoyed by my guests. thanks. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal satyne reply i was quite cautious with the heat on this and ended up having to add more chilli, so don't be afraid, it needs the heat. really liked being able to roast the potatoes rather than frying them. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vickirecipes reply this has been a favourite dish of mine for a long time, but i've only made it a few times.  this was a really easy way to prepare it.  cooking for some young tastebuds i went easy on the spice and the smoky paprika, the sauce was still very flavourful.  it was maybe a tad sweet for me, so i'd probably cut the sugar down to 1/2 tsp next time, probably depends on your tomatoes as well.  aside from your tapas table, these would be an amazing addition to brunch and this recipe makes that an easy task.  thanks for sharing ft! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal magpie diner reply well, i've been on a patatas bravas kick ever since i tried another one on recipezaar.  this was excellent, a bit sweeter and less hot than the other, and this had more tomato taste.  i did make sure to use the smokey paprika.  i liked the way the potatoes browned in this recipe, and although this recipe suggested serving it with a mayonnaise sauce (as did the other), i did not this time.   i preferred it with the mayo sauce, but this was quite excellent too!  thanks ft. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kumquat the cats fr reply this recipe is absolutely to-die-for! while the potatoes are what you'd expect from roasted potatoes the sauce is amazing! i made it as is, (don't forego the smoked paprika's the smokey flavour is what this sauce is all about!) i had no parsley so i used chopoped fresh basil. made for the spanish leg of zwt5 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kristinv reply"
"i've made similar recipes in the past and i think it should be understood how long it takes to cook the potatoes and onions in oil.  i figured at least a 1/2 hour, if not more time.  the recipe is very authentic though, and i usually make it with one less potato. the suggestion to have some oil in the pan before you pour the eggs is very important.  thanks for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal joan hartman reply 12 i'm sorry but the instructions make no sense to me. i won't be trying this recipe icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal linda z. reply 6 good, but i wouldn't try it for breakfast. i think this is a brunch kind of thing. takes a little too much coordination to work early in the morning ;) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rouxdog reply 6 see 1 reply the directions are very confusing. came out is one big mess. i will never make this recipe again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jodythecat reply 5 you can make this in the oven as well. make it the night before up to the baking part, then pop it in the oven for about 45 minutes. lots of recipes to choose from. i usually put some cheese in too but i love cheese with everything icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal collilly reply 2"
"i could not stop eating this! the crispy chorizo with the sauce was out of this world! you definitely need some crusty bread for soaking up the sauce because it's that good. can't wait to make it again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 3 very unique and tasty tapas.  perfect with a robust red wine or hearty beer.  seemed a little one dimensional, but in conjunction with other appetizers would probably hold its own.  pretty, tasty, extravagant with toasted bread.  bread is a must here. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal vicki in ct reply 1"
"this recipe is very simple. make sure you add a bit more water than the recipe calls for or else you won't have a soupy consistency. i added a bit more garlic and pepper to mine to give it a bit more flavor. otherwise a very low key meal to make during the week. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal samrunge reply 2 i made this the other day and i'm so glad i did! i thought it was perfect. reminded me of a dish i had in spain years ago. simple but delicious. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 very tasty!  i made this with some smoked chorizo and it came out great.   i do agree with some of the other reviews to add more water for a more soupy consistency but i suspect that if you bring it to a quick boil and then set it to simmer quickly, you may not need as much.  i also added one more clove a garlic as well simply because i love garlic.  adding this to my list of favorites. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kristina m. reply 1 yes, this soup will not be very soupy, but that's how it's eaten in spain.  i've looked all over for a good lentejas recipe, also one of my favorite spanish recipes, one that is not watery or soupy, so i'm thrilled i found this.  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal livimeikle reply 1 this was very good, i used 3 cups chicken stock instead of water, and added 1 tsp smoked paprika. yes it was thick, more like a stew. we ate it over white rice, it was delicious! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal icecreamqueen63 reply"
"i really wish that people would stop reviewing recipes that they have totally changed. i only want to hear from people who actually cooked this paella with the ingredients and techniques that the writer describes. if you want to create your own recipe, be my guest; but don't do it at the the expense of this fine cook. and please, paella is made with whatever you have on hand. it's a dish for common people, not food snobs. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rabbit3 reply 14 see 1 reply if people like ignacio and gloria can leave one star reviews w/o making this recipe then i can leave a five star review even though i haven't made it yet. cooking sites are replete with trolls who jump in saying things like, ""this is not ""authentic"" spanish paella...etc. or, just dim things like, ""you lost me at the rabbit."" yeah, that's helpful. i'll bet you get lost a lot. oh, and did you notice neither of those people have left any other reviews or posted any recipes or even saved any recipes on this site? i plan on making this delicious sounding dish sometime soon and if it rates less than five stars. i'll change my rating. but until then my uninformed opinion is worth as much as ignacio's and gloria's. and i have reviewed a number of recipes on this site giving high ratings to most because i choose carefully and have only posted one recipe but it's a terrific one. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal redox reply 10 see 1 reply sorry ignacio, but you don't know what you are talking about, rabbit was often used in paella to feed the farm workers in the valencia area, paella would very often have what ever meat was available. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal matthew s. reply 8 see 1 reply this is not ""authentic"" spanish paella. it's just another rice dish that -resembles- paella, but is not. never have i seen such an aberrancy to mix seafood with chicken or rabbit. certainly disgusting. whoever wrote this never went to valencia and ate a legitimate paella. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ignacio n. reply 6 see 4 replies i just made this today, and it was excellent!  my husband said it was some of the best paella he's ever had.  i made a few mistakes that i will correct next time.  i did mine in in an enameled dutch oven on the stove top.  i ended up burning it badly to the bottom of the pan, so next time i will use lower heat and cook longer if necessary.  i also might add the green beans later on (i added them towards the beginning).  i left out the rabbit and chicken, and i used dried thyme because fresh wasn't available.  i also used bouillon with the added herbs.  it still turned out great.  it must be even better if you follow the directions exactly. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stovepipe reply 4"

rinshinomori, this is an absolutely wonderful, authentic, simple soup. fabulous flavor. i made it with a spanish smoked paprika, so the flavor is slightly different from using a simple sweet paprika, but it is not in the least ""spicy hot"" ... and the combination of chicken stock and egg threads makes it a ""comfort soup"" for so many cultures, as well as a classic iberian mix of flavors. thanks so much for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gandalf the white reply 2 this recipe reminded me of garlic bread in the best way possible. it's like garlic bread soup. the egg in it is so good! i loved how simple it was to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 i've been interested in trying a ""sopa de ajo"" after seeing dozens in my spanish cookbooks, but was hesitant.  my daughter's bridal shower provided the perfect opportunity since she wanted a spanish theme as she and her future husband will be doing the ""camino de santiago"" as a honeymoon trip.  it was simple and more delicious than i could have imagined.  it proved a very popular offering!  it reheats well if you take it slow. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal umiller2000 reply 1 easy to make, delicious, and perfect for when the family comes down with a cold!  thanks for the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dejah b. reply 1 my family and i loved this soup! also a great way to make the most of a lot of stale sourdough! i bulked it up with some onion and carrot before sautéing the garlic and gave it a little extra acidity to balance out the excess vegetables' water by replacing the white wine with champagne vinegar. all in all a great rustic soup that you can whip up really fast in a pinch. could also function as a rich stew-like base for leftover roast chicken or ham you might have on hand. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sarah t. reply"
"i had the recipe tweaked by adding a dash of teriyaki sauce and it tasted even better. it was quick to make too! i love it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stella a. reply 1 very good. substituted old bay for the red pepper. it was a lot of butter, may cut it in half next time. will definitely make again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal donna reply 1 this was delicious!!!  i did add some thinly sliced shallots and minced red peppers to the garlic to saute and then with the lemon juice and paprika i added some white wine to make a little more sauce and serve it over angel hair pasta...topped with fresh minced parsley and some parm.  dh gobbled it down and wanted more.  (i guess i shouldn't have cut the recipe in half).  i did serve it with sauteed spinach, shallots and a little minced garlic and french bread and it made for a wonderful meal.  this is going into my favorites of 2010.  thank you for such a wonderful recipe.  made for think pink cancer awareness 2010. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mama smurf reply 1 we ahve a local spanish reatuarant and they serve gambas al ajillo as as starter and these are just as good , if not  better. i have been looking for a similar and this is most defo it. thanks for posting icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cfcbex reply 1 just delicious. i had 1 lb shrimp, so used 3 tbl olive oil and 2 tbl ghee (instead of butter). ghee is really great for sauteing, as it has no water in it, and will sustain higher temperatures without burning. i also used white wine instead of lemon juice and smoked paprika (1/2 tsp), to avoid a trip to the market for just two items. wonderful with crusty bread to mop up the sauce. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal duonyte reply"
"this was so much fun to make! the custard was super easy and tasted great. it's like a creme brûlée without the cream. loved it! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 2 we really liked this a lot but i will put a little less lemon in it next time because the kids didnt really enjoy it that much. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bet0625 reply 1 very much enjoyed, a lighter, looser texture than creme brulee, with a delicate flavour, my husband was pleasantly surprised by this (for us) unusual dessert.  not difficult to make, i was quite nervous about over-cooking it, but it was fine.

i made it the day before and let it sit overnight in the fridge, putting it under the grill the following evening.

this made six desserts in small ramekins, for me.

thanks, annacia! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal karen elizabeth reply this pudding has a wonderfully lemony flavor.  lighter in texture than a creme brulee and to me, other than caramelizing the top upon completion i am not entirely sure the two are similar. i used my kitchen torch for the final touch.   i enjoyed this very much and will make again!  thank you, annacia! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bev i am reply this recipe is very similar to a recipe i found on spain recipes (only the directions are a tad bit different) for crema catalan. this has a good flavor but i personally prefer the smother texture of crã¨me brule. the directions donâ€™t mention when or where to put the cornstarch so i submitted a correction. thanks for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamadelogan reply"

"while this was tasty the night it was made it was even better the next day. i grated everything in the food processer which gave it a nice texture to go with the wonderful flavors. used heirloom tomatoes and fresh baked french bread and highly recommend you use the best ingredients you can get put your feet up and just savor the flavors. thanks for the post. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal debbwl reply unique alternative to bruschetta to serve in hot weather! next time i will crush up the walnuts more because some bites had a huge walnut and some had none. other cheeses could be substituted for manchego - a favorite on its own but not worth the extra expense with all the other flavors here. the rosemary is a must! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flkeysjen reply this was awesome!! we very much enjoyed this for a refreshing supper. i have to admit that i was not totally sure about the instructions because the walnuts are double, so i put one batch toasted walnuts into the processor with the tomatoes and sprinkled the rest on top for serving. the rosemary and walnuts are a perfect match. thanks for sharing!<br/>made for the lively lemon lovelies for zwt 8 / spain/portugal icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mia in germany reply"

"i know this is a dish that is often eaten for breakfast in spain. breakfast, snack, appetizer, dinner - it would be delicious anytime. the simplicity of the dish calls for quality ingredients - we had a great ciabatta that i sliced and toasted - would love it on the grill, the tomato was ok - this is not the best time of year for fresh tomatoes in the nw, fresh garlic and of course really good  evoo - which helped out my tomato . i can't wait to try this again with my home grown tomatoes at the end of summer! made for ""my food odyssey"" - andorra icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal momaphet reply see 1 reply i'm glad i tried this and look forward to trying it again when summer tomatoes are in season. i served it with albanian tossed salad for my food odyssey. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal susie d reply yummy! i bought some really good multigrain bread and used that with this recipe. i love when a simple recipe has a big impact. lots of flavor from the garlic and tomato. yummy! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lifeisgood reply years ago one of our catalonian exchange students taught me to make this yummy toast. i had some top quality ingredients on hand, so made this for lunch today. and because i'm a sucker for red onion and anchovies, i added some of both. yum, yum, yum! thanks for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal leggy peggy reply yayyayay this is amazing!! i love this sooo much... i have it in my all time favs. if you haven't had this... try it. use fresh tomatoes and the best olive oil and salt and bread... you'll be in for a major treat. :d

"i don't think this is such a visually appealing salad, but once i tasted it for seasonings, i just wanted to keep eating and eating it. it's so delicious. i had small tomatoes, onions and capsicum, so used only two eggplant and 3/4 cup oil and under 1/2 a cup of lemon juice. i grow curly parsley and love it, so i  used a very generous half cup of that. i heated up my oven, bunged everything including the capsicums) in and removed them as they looked done enough. that worked well for me. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal justjans reply 3 i'm so glad i found this recipe and i had all the ingredients on hand!<br/>the only big change was to use fresh cherry tomatoes; i didn't peel them.<br/>i tried the salad now and i can't wait my family members are at home to have dinner.<br/>thanks a lot for this recipe. done for 1-2-3 tag game. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal artandkitchen reply 2 thanks to the lovely photo that awalde posted, i had to try this recipe.  i used the last of my fresh from the garden eggplant and a yellow onion.  i followed justjans and all the vegetables were tossed in together, drizzled lightly with oil and roasted.  as they cooked they were removed from the mix.  this was served at room temperature but leftovers were served chilled.  it is delicious either way. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal paulag reply"
"my friend who is a pretty good cook made this for a party, he isn't into zaar, so i suggested with many suggestions from other zaarites and then gave it to him.  he followed exactly and it was yummy.  he has an outdoor wood grill which was perfect since most of his meals he cooks that ways, so it was ideal. and he got the good chorizo too.  it was worth it. we just reheated for a few minutes in the same dishes on the grill tinight just to warm up and then sliced for all the guests.  

very very nice.  absolutely not a bite left which is always a good sign.
kim icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sarasotacook reply 1 buy good chorizo because that will make all the difference.  this is a great dish that's easy and very tasty! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sawyer.jody reply 1 this was nothing but excellent!  had to send off for the chorizo.  couldn't find any decent one here!  served as part of a tapas lunch.  didn't change a thing.  thnx for posting, ft.  made for zwt5 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal darkhunter reply 1 made this as an appetizer for a family meal. everyone loved it. it was very easy to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal shyeyes6 reply there used to be a good tapas bar in georgetown ( d.c. ) that used to serve something like these. the only thing different was they sprinkled dry rosemary on them also! boy does this take me back a few years! thanks for a grand reminder of my wilding days!

i have been making these often and experimenting with the herbs, wine and spices.
this last time i made these ( christmas weekend 2007 ) i used a comination of red wine ans dry sherry, fresh rosemary and 6 crushed juniper berries... took it to a whole other level... thanks ft! this is still one my family's favorites! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef shadows reply"
"excellent dish. the crucial thing is not to cover the ingredients; we used 1/4 cup olive oil, and then, five minutes later, 1/2 cup of champagne. it bubbled up over the ingredients, turning yellow with saffron. we didn't add water, so some of the potatoes and fish steamed rather than boiled. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal james elkins reply thought this dish was great.  very filling.  not sure if that was all due to the potatoes.  i used a variety of fish (whatever variety i found at the store) the blend of saffron and wine was excellent, would recommend this dish to everyone. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal matoszinho reply we loved this... it's an excellent recipe where things can be added for personal taste. dh, although he liked it as it was, said that he fancied garlic in it next time and more wine lol, for me i'd like to have added a little more saffron becuase it's a taste that i am enjoying more and more. i will experiment with it and get it perfect for us. dh made this and since i'm being careful with the calories he did cut back the olive oil a lot... half a cup seemed a little much and it was still really good with less. please see my rating system: a wonderful 4 stars for a very authentic portuguese recipe that tasted lovely and that we will be making again. thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kiwidutch reply"
"we just did not like this. we found it way to harsh and bitter. this has great potential- in that i agree with kelly-but it just needed something to mellow it out and make it palatable. a real shame since scallops of this size are very pricey! i hate to give bad reviews. i do wish you lots of luck chef and hope others found this recipe to their liking. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mamas kitchen hope reply this recipe has potential to be great. i found it to be too tart for my taste all the juice and the zest...i would cut back on one or the other.  it's a very visually appealing dish with the tomatoes adding nice color. i did cut down a step to save on cleanup and seared the scallops first then removed them from the pan, made the sauce and added them back in. 
it worked well. all in all i thought it was good and with some tweeking could be a really great recipe. nice effort for the contest! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal girleatsworld reply i served over rice. this does make lots of yummy sauce that can be cut in 1/2 with more to spare. i did use cherry tomatoes. pinch of red pepper flakes doesn`t make this spicy so if you are looking for heat go for a lot more. but then again the heat would take away from the delicate taste of the scallops. thanks for a yummy dish which would be lower in fat if you cut back on the sauce.:)the wine can be adding all at one time without losing it`s flavor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rita1652 reply"
"these tasted so similar to the ones i get in spain. the only thing i would alter in this recipe is the amount of flour. i recommend adding flour until the dough becomes matted but not crumbled. and knead, knead, knead until the dough is smooth! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tortschef reply those look sooo good, i think i'll use this recipe for my class. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kira ohmony reply"
"this was a big hit and great way to use summer's bountiful zucchini!  i did make this all in one pan, adding the onions, garlic, and zucchini together, but i really didn't have any liquid to strain off.  although i added a generous amount of lemon juice, i didn't really notice it.  i have never peeled zucchini before,  but think that might be what gave it a sort of sweetness, which went nicely with the onion.  a lovely, summertime breakfast!  made for zwt 8. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jackieohno! reply 2 i scaled this back for 1 serve and was only using 1 pan so i cooked up my zucchini first (left skin on) and then drained that on paper towel and cleaned out pan and then cooked up the onion and garlic amd then proceded as per recipe from step 4 for what was a delicious breakfast though i found the addition of lemon juice strange it was quite pleasant with the zucchini and onion and the herbs.  thank you baby kato, made for went to market tag game. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal i'mpat reply 2 this was yummy. i didn't peel the zucchini but made the rest of the recipe as directed. nice satisfying meal. thanks bk for sharing. made for zwt8 spain/portugal. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lazyme reply 1 this was delicious, loved the flavor that the lemon, oregano and parsley gave the eggs. i did leave the peel on the zucchini, but followed the rest of the directions. thank you.  made for zwt 8 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal momluvs6 reply 1 this was so good . i was a little worried about the seasoning never having had lemon juice before .it was good  made for zaar tour 8 icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal dienia b. reply 1"

"i used skinless flounder, so skipped the frying part, placed in a single layer in a large baking dish, used vermouth instead of white wine - this adds additional herbal notes and works very well with a dish like this. mine did not brown by the time the fish was done, and had i realized how much liquid was left, i would have made a little sauce to nap the fish with - now the juices are strained and frozen for a future fishy soup. this went nicely with rice and mixed veggies. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal duonyte reply wow, what a fantastic, quick and easy meal! the only thing i adjusted was adding a few chopped anchovies to the oil before frying the fish. will definitely make this again! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal julieslick reply wow! delicious recipe for fish! i actually used a basa fillet with no skin so i of course skipped the part dealing with the skin. i used a non-stick skillet with a metal handle so

"this is really good, creamy, with a nice light lemon flavour but it is a lot of work. blanching almonds is easy though. the whole almond with skin on only has to sit 3 minutes in boiling water (off the boil) and then the skin of each almond can easily be popped off using your fingers. i reduced the sugar a little i think, didn't use a measuring cup (never do) but i don't think i reduced it by half. i used sea salt & spring water plus the rest. i would make this again and like to try it with less almonds as it uses a lot and i think it would be just as creamy using somewhat less. made for veggie swap 32 ~ march 2011. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ummbinat reply i`m a freak when it comes to using the whole food and for ease of perpetration of recipes. so i skipped the removal of the skins, placed the almonds in my vita mixx the (dry container) and blended till a powder added the remaining ingredients using lime in place of lemon. i did find this delish but next time i would 1/2 the sugar back by 1/2. i used this to make for recipe #176274. healthy comforting drink for those that are lactose intolerant!! thank you for the tasty goodness! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rita1652 reply"
