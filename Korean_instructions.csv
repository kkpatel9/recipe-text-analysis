Instructions
"directions cut cabbage into four sections through the core. starting at the end of the leaves, cut cabbage diagonally back and forth until you reach the core.  (cabbage will be in large square pieces). cut radish into large chunks (if you want to be able to use them independently) or into julienne strips. layer cabbage and radish in your sink with the salt.  put about 1/2 cup salt for every two inches of cabbage.  make sure you end with salt. add water to almost cover cabbage. let stand.  after 1 1/2 hours start checking the cabbage by rubbing a piece between your fingers.  if it's slippery, rinse it and taste it.  if it's pleasantly salty then it's ready.  be sure not to let the cabbage stand too long or it will become too salty and will be inedible. fill the sink with water until it covers the cabbage then fish the cabbage out of the sink.  return the cabbage to the sink and rinse it this way two or three times until all the cabbage is thoroughly rinsed. drain cabbage by placing it in large colander or by letting it sit in your unstopped sink. make the pul by mixing the rice flour and water in a small sauce pan and heating to boiling, stirring constantly.  let cool.  if you don't have rice flour you can add water to cooked rice and boil it until the water is very cloudy.  use one cup of this water. mix pul and remaining ingredients in very large bowl.  the amount of red pepper you use should depend on how hot you want your kim chee.  there are many kinds of fish sauce.  the one cup measurement is for a thin sauce (consistency like soy sauce).  for thicker sauces, use less sauce (1/4 to 1/2 cup). wearing plastic or rubber gloves, begin mixing the cabbage with the sauce.  use your hands and mix a little cabbage at a time then push it to the side of the bowl until you have mixed all the cabbage.  this will help you mix the cabbage and sauce evenly. place kim chee in large containers that have tight fitting lids (otherwise it will smell up your fridge). you can eat the kim chee immediately, but most korean women recommend that you leave it outside of the fridge for one day, then store it in the fridge but wait one week after that before you eat it.  i can't tell you what the difference is because my husband doesn't wait that long. enjoy."
"directions cut up vegetables, kimchi and tofu and set aside. rinse meat, cut into thin strips 1-2"" long. marinate meat in rice wine with two pinches black pepper for 15 minutes (you can use your stew pot for this). meanwhile, add vegetable oil to pan or wok and cook kimchi on medium-high until done (usually 5-7 minutes). stir consistently. kimchi will turn slightly translucent. in a separate bowl, combine soup base ingredients and mash together. add vegetables, kimchi, soup base and water to the pot with the meat, leaving out the tofu. use kimchi juice as part of the water if extracted. bring to a boil; leave on a rolling boil until meat is cooked or about 5 minutes, being careful not to let water boil away. taste soup for adjustments; add water as needed, or make extra soup base if needed. as soon as the meat is done, turn the heat down to low, add the tofu slices. stir gently, serve with rice (your mouth will be hot -- i like to use rice that is room-temp!)."
"directions to cut beef at 1/16th of an inch, it is easier if the meat is partially frozen. combine brown sugar through garlic in a large zip-lock bag and stir. add the beef slices and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour. heat a large non-stick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat and add beef, discarding remaining marinade. cook approximately 8 minutes turning frequently, or until desired degree of doneness. if you prefer to grill, place a wire grilling basket coated with cooking spray on grill rack, and grill 8 minutes, turning frequently. serve over jasmine rice."
"directions to prepare beef, sprinkle cornstarch over beef; toss to combine. add 1 tablespoon soy sauce and next 4 ingredients (1 tablespoon soy sauce through 3 garlic cloves); toss well to coat. cover and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour. heat a large nonstick skillet or wok coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. add beef mixture; stir-fry 3 minutes or until done. remove mixture from pan. cover and keep warm. to prepare noodles, pour boiling water over noodles; let stand 10 minutes or until tender. drain and rinse with cold water. drain. snip noodles several times with kitchen shears. to prepare vegetables, wipe skillet or wok clean with paper towels. heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil and vegetable oil in pan over medium-high heat. add red pepper and 5 garlic cloves; stir-fry 30 seconds. add mushrooms, onions, and carrot; stir-fry 3 minutes. add half of spinach; stir-fry 2 minutes or until spinach wilts. add remaining spinach; stir-fry 2 minutes or until spinach wilts. reduce heat to medium-low. add beef mixture and noodles to pan, stirring well to combine. combine 1/3 cup soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, and 1 tablespoon sesame oil, stirring with a whisk. drizzle over noodle mixture; stir well to combine. cook over medium-low heat 3 minutes or until thoroughly heated. sprinkle with sesame seeds."
"directions rinse short ribs under the faucet to get rid of loose bone bits. soak the short ribs in water for 10 minutes to drain out some of the blood. they can be soaked in a roasting pan, ziploc bag, or large bowl--- whatever container you would like to use for marinating. in your marinating container, combine sugar, water, soy sauce, sesame oil, onion, garlic, sesame seeds and scallions. dissolve the sugar into the mixture as much as possible, but it will likely not become totally dissolved. lay rib pieces in the marinade, dispersing onion slices between and on top of the meat and submerging the meat as much as possible. let the beef marinate in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes, and ideally overnight. line the grill with foil and poke holes in the foil. on medium high heat, grill the short ribs 5-7 minutes on each side until the meat is cooked medium-well and the bones do not bleed. in my opinion, this particular dish is best with a bit of burnt edges and near-well-doneness. serve with rice. alternatively, add extra flair! wash and break off whole leaves of red lettuce and place on a serving plate (note: red lettuce is not actually red and is widely available in grocery stores). in a small bowl, toss long thin slices of scallion with sesame oil and red pepper flakes. serve short ribs cut into thirds or about 1 inch squares (kitchen shears work best). in a small dish, place spicy bean paste or hot sauce. to assemble, wrap each piece of meat in a red lettuce leaf with scallion mixture and a dot of the spicy sauce."
