(sorry, i don't use a thermometer). now, working in batches, carefully add a small portion of the chicken pieces to the oil and gently roll for 2 minutes (or until chicken is cooked thru). do not over crowd the pan because it will drop the oil temp and you will have greasy chicken rather than crispy. remove the pieces using a metal slotted spoon (or a spider) to a paper towel lined plate, let oil temp return and begin another batch. when all chicken pieces are done and thoroughly drained, toss them into the pan with the heated marinade. serve immediately over white rice and garnish with sesame seeds and scallions, if using. enjoy!"
