Instructions
"directions heat the oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted. add the flour and cook 1-2 minutes while whisking frequently. gradually add the milk while whisking and continue to cook another 2-3 minutes. the mixture should be smooth. switch to a wooden spoon and stir in the ham, cheese and nutmeg. cook another 1-2 minutes while stirring.  the mixture will pull away from the sides of the pan. taste the mixture and add kosher salt if desired.  if the ham and cheese are salty so you probably won’t need to add any additional salt. transfer the mixture to an 8x8-inch baking tray and spread it out so that it is even. let the mixture cool, then cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. when ready to cook the croquettes, lightly beat the eggs in a shallow dish. mix the panko and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in another dish. scoop up tablespoons of the cooled filling and form them into balls. dip each ball into the egg and then the panko. place the completed croquettes on a wire rack or baking sheet and refrigerate for 20 minutes. the croquettes must be chilled before frying otherwise they may fall apart in the oil. meanwhile, make the aioli by pureeing the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and smoked paprika in a blender or mini food processor. transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve. pour enough vegetable oil into a large stockpot to reach a depth of 1 inch and heat over medium high heat. working in batches, fry the croquettes in the oil, turning them on all sides, until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. drain on paper towels. serve immediately with the smoked paprika aioli."
"directions cut thick slices from loaf of bread and toast both sides lightly under the broiler. drizzle 1 side of bread slices generously with olive oil. cut a very ripe tomato in half.  rub it over the toasted bread, squeezing gently and leaving juice and pulp. sprinkle generously with garlic salt (or minced garlic and salt). reheat gently under broiler and serve."
"directions *soak beans overnight. make sure they are fully covered in water.*. cut ham into 1"" cubes. add ham, except 2 pieces of ham, and 6 chorizo into pot of water. bring to boil and then reduce heat. drain beans. pour olive oil and onions in pot with beans and stir over medium high heat. add 2 chorizos and 2 pieces of ham. add water just to cover the beans. let it boil then reduce heat to medium low- low. stir in saffron. cover pot, but not tightly. cook for 2 - 2 1/2 hours or until beans are soft. check often to ensure water is still covering beans. when the water level is too low, add the water from the pot of meats. stir pot of beans with a wooden spoon occasionally. check taste and salt and butter as desired. drain pot of meats and then serve fabada with the meats. enjoy!"
"directions rinse well the tomatoes,take off the stems. peel the garlic clove. peel the onion, chop in 3-4 pieces. rinse the pepper, get rid of any single seed, chop coarsely. peel well the cucumber, no green left. place the piece of bread in a bowl with water in order to soak it. once soaked, put all water away, squeeze the soaked bread with your bare hands as much as you can and set aside. in a good blender or food processor (i have a german marvel called thermomix) put the tomatoes (previously cut in 4-5 pieces each), the garlic, onion, pepper, cucumber, squeezed bread. add remaining ingredients and crush all up at the highest speed and power your machine can work. no temperature please!  go on until no minimum little piece of anything can be noticed when you try the gazpacho.  it must be creamy and with some consistency, not watery like. pour it in a jar or bowl and let it chill in your fridge.  the chilliest the better.  do not freeze!  serve it in bowls as a first course for any meal. notes: always try the cucumber before adding it.  if it is sour, your gazpacho will be ruined. for the best results, use spanish (from spain, europe) olive oil.  italian could suit, but believe me ours is much better, though not so well known. keeps well in fridge for a week, guess it won't last you a day, so good it is!"
"directions (serves 10-12 with other dishes). prepare ahead by heating the oil in a pan, add the onion and fry for about 5 minutes until softened. add the garlic, tomatoes, tomato purée, two types of paprika, chilli powder, sugar and salt and bring to the boil, stirring. simmer for 10 minutes until pulpy. set aside for up to 24 hours. to serve, preheat the oven to 200c/gas 6/fan oven 180°c cut the potatoes into small cubes and pat dry with kitchen paper. spread over a roasting tin and toss in the oil, then season. roast for 40-50 minutes, until the potatoes are crisp and golden. tip the potatoes into dishes and spoon over the reheated sauce. sprinkle with the parsley. serve with cocktail sticks."

"directions it's best to have all of your ingredients prepared before you start cooking. prepare the rabbit by separating the legs, cutting remaining meat into small slices and lightly salting. (in my area rabbit is seasonal. during the summer and fall i substitute with chicken legs). i peel my shrimp, leaving only the tail and then salt them. in spain they tend to leave the shrimp unshelled. i always try to make my chicken stock from scratch (time permitting), adding a bit of rosemary, a tiny pinch of saffron and a bit of thyme. if you're going to use bouillon, i'd recommend at least heating it up with these herbs and then straining before you start. keep your stock hot but not boiling as you cook. coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil. brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. do not fully cook, just get the outside well browned. set aside. this should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil. brown the rabbit for 2-3 minutes. it should not be fully cooked. set aside. brown garlic, onion and bell pepper until they're softened, adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished. push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. caramelize it, flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat). mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika, parsley and thyme. add rice, mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. as the rice browns mix in the saffron. make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils. when the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. if it's been kept warm, it will begin to boil almost immediately. lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil. this is where paella is made and broken. i stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes, adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. after this you must let the paella sit! let it cook another 10-20 minutes (i find that this step takes longer on a stovetop), adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. don't worry about rice burning to the bottom, this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment, it's something like socarrat) is a tasty delicacy. once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side. when the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover. you must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. i've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess. patience is the key. once you're sure it's ready uncover, garnish with lemon wedges and enjoy!"
directions cut veal and ham steaks into chunks. mince onion and garlic peel and cut potatoes into cubes. skin and cut choizo into 1/4 inch round slices. in a large soup pot add the beans with their liquid. then place all remaining ingredients. mix well and let cook over low flame for about 3 hours. serve in soup bowls with toated italian bread for dunking on the side.

"directions whisk egg whites with the salt until stiff peaks form. set aside. beat egg yolks with the sugar until light and fluffy. add the butter and half of the flour. gently fold in half of the egg whites. then fold in the remainder of the flour and last the rest of the egg whites. heat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit/ 240 degrees celsius.grease and line a baking sheet with wax paper, then grease the wax paper again. then spread batter evenly onto sheet. bake for aprox. 7 minutes or until firm and pale but not golden. while it bakes get your filling ready and set a moist,clean towel on a clean flat surface, which should be big enough to cover the entire cake. remove the cake from the oven and quickly invert it onto the towel, remove the paper and spread dulce de leche and top with marmalade on top and roll the cake. wrap cake with the towel and refrigerate up to a day before or 3 hours minimum. remove and decorate."
"directions fill a large soup pot with water, enough to submerge the octopus. cut onion in half and add to water, along with the bay leaves. some will say that also adding a wine cork (yes a wine cork) will ensure a tender octopus. you are within your rights to use your culinary judgement on that particular point. hehe bring the water to boiling, and submerge the octopus 3 or 4 times, to scald it basically. bring the water back to a boil and place the octopus in the water. this time we will leave it in there. reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the octopus 20 minutes-- a larger octopus will require longer cooking time-- up to 45 minutes. remove from water, and slice diagonally into rounds (ovals really). the slices should be about 1/2"" thick. presentation: arrange potato rounds on a plate or wooden serving tablet and top each with a slice of octopus. the potato should be about the same size as the octopus slices, if not, then cut potatoes accordingly. liberally sprinkle paprika and sea salt over all and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. you may wish to garnish with chopped parsley."
"directions preheat oven to 450 degrees. season the flour generously with salt and pepper (depending on the size of your fillets, you may need extra seasoned flour). dredge the skin side of the hake fillets in the seasoned flour, shake off the excess, and set aside. heat a shallow flameproof casserole over high heat until you can feel the rising heat.  add the oil and heat until hot, about 30 seconds. add the hake fillets, skin side down, and cook for about 3 minutes until the skin is golden brown. turn the fish over and season with salt and pepper (to taste). pour in the wine and add the garlic, scallions, and parsely. transfer the casserole to oven and bake, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the fish flakes easily."
"directions the first step is to remove the skins from the almonds. the best way to do this is to simply buy them already skinless. if none are available, you will have to boil the skins off. put the almonds in a pot of boiling water and let sit until the skins become very soft. with time, the skins will dissolve or slide off easily when stirred. boiling the almonds is a pain. crush or otherwise pulverise the almonds into a coarse powder. if you boiled your almonds to get the skins off, then smash them (or put them in a strong blender while adding some water) into a mush. in a large bowl/container add the 2.5 liters of water with a pinch of salt. slice and add the lemon. now mix in the almond powder (or mush). cover the container and let it sit at room temperature for 2 hours. when the two hours are up, add the sugar and cinnamon stick. stir until sugar is completely dissolved. strain the liquid with a fine cloth. this removes all of the larger particles of almond. strain until texture is smooth (twice should do it). keep the drink in your fridge and it will stay good for at least five days. for a truly divine experience, put some in your freezer until it is an icy slush!"
"directions combine first 4 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. cover, reduce heat, and simmer 40 minutes or until done. stir in chopped parsley, black pepper, salt, and tomatoes. cook 3 minutes. remove from heat. preheat oven to 400°. spoon about 3 tablespoons rice mixture into each piquillo pepper. place stuffed peppers in an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray. sprinkle evenly with manchego cheese. bake at 400° for 10 minutes or until peppers are thoroughly heated. garnish with parsley sprigs, if desired."
"directions marinate oranges and onion in olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper for 15 minutes to one hour. add to salad greens and toss."
directions remove the top shell from the mussels and arrange them on a platter. sprinkle the mussels evenly with the peppers and onion. drizzle liberal amounts of extra virgin olive oil over the platter. generously squeeze lemon juice over the ingredients.  season to taste with salt and pepper.
"directions it's best to have all of your ingredients prepared before you start cooking. prepare the rabbit by separating the legs, cutting remaining meat into small slices and lightly salting. (in my area rabbit is seasonal. during the summer and fall i substitute with chicken legs). i peel my shrimp, leaving only the tail and then salt them. in spain they tend to leave the shrimp unshelled. i always try to make my chicken stock from scratch (time permitting), adding a bit of rosemary, a tiny pinch of saffron and a bit of thyme. if you're going to use bouillon, i'd recommend at least heating it up with these herbs and then straining before you start. keep your stock hot but not boiling as you cook. coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil. brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. do not fully cook, just get the outside well browned. set aside. this should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil. brown the rabbit for 2-3 minutes. it should not be fully cooked. set aside. brown garlic, onion and bell pepper until they're softened, adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished. push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. caramelize it, flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat). mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika, parsley and thyme. add rice, mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. as the rice browns mix in the saffron. make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils. when the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. if it's been kept warm, it will begin to boil almost immediately. lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil. this is where paella is made and broken. i stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes, adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. after this you must let the paella sit! let it cook another 10-20 minutes (i find that this step takes longer on a stovetop), adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. don't worry about rice burning to the bottom, this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment, it's something like socarrat) is a tasty delicacy. once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side. when the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover. you must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. i've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess. patience is the key. once you're sure it's ready uncover, garnish with lemon wedges and enjoy!"
"directions preheat oven to 400. peel, core and slice apples. roll out puff pastry on a floured surface and place in a 9-inch pie pan.  trim any pastry that hangs over the edges. arrange apple slices in pastry shell; pour lemon juice over apples. place tart in its pan on a cookie sheet and place on middle oven rack. bake for about 30 minutes, covering pastry edges with foil if browning too quickly. remove from oven and sprinkle with cinnamon.  cool for 10 minutes. spread apricot jam over tart to glaze (have jam at room temperature or warm it slightly - this will make it easier to spread)."
"directions preheat oven to 400 degrees. brown chicken with salt and pepper in separate skillet over med-high heat until cooked through (about 10 minutes). set aside and keep warm. brown skirt steak with salt and pepper in separate skillet over med-high heat until medium rare (about 5 minutes). set aside and keep warm. using paella pan (enamel/cast iron/dutch) with olive oil over med-high heat sauté onions, garlic, bell pepper, and chorizo until chorizo is browned (about 10 minutes). add rice, stock, turmeric, saffron and bring to a boil. add the previously set aside proteins and frozen peas, stir all ingredients combined. immediately place into preheated 400 degree oven for 20-30 minutes (or until liquid has evaporated). serve immediately."
"directions prick sausage in several places with a pin and place in a paella pan or electric skillet with 1/4 inch water; cover and simmer slowly 5 minutes, then drain, discarding liquid. cut sausage into 1/2-inch pieces and saute' in pan with the oil until lightly browned; stir in onions and peppers. cover and cook slowly until vegetables are tender. remove with a slotted spoon, leaving fat in pan. dry chicken pieces in paper towels, heat fat in pan, and brown chicken on all sides. drain fat out of pan, add the sausage and vegetables, then the remaining ingredients. cover and simmer slowly for 15 minutes--chicken will be one-half to two-thirds cooked, and will finish later, with the rice. (may be cooked in advance; bring to the boil before proceeding.) about half an hour before serving, bring chicken and sausage to the rapid boil on top of the stove. sprinkle in the rice, mixing it down into the liquid with a spoon. boil rapidly 5 to 6 minutes, uncovered--do not stir the rice. when it has swollen and begun to rise to the surface, rapidly push the shrimp, tail end down, into the rice; strew on the tomatoes, peas or beans, chickpeas, and olives. again, do not stir, simply push these ingredients down into the rice with a spoon. carefully correct seasoning. reduce heat and let paella simmer for another 8 to 10 minutes, or more, uncovered, until rice is just tender--slightly al dente. (it is best not to cover the pan, but if you feel the rice is not cooking properly, cover for a few minutes, sprinkling on a few tbsps. or so of stock or water if rice seems dry; then uncover to finish cooking.) at the end of the cooking, the rice will have absorbed the liquid. serve the paella from its cooking pan, and decorate with the lemon quarters and parsley. note: when finished cooking, i will cover and let sit for 5-10 minutes before serving."
"directions wash and slice the tomatoes in thick slices. season them. mix the basil with the breadcrumbs. beat the eggs in a bowl. dry the tomatoes with paper towels. pass the tomatoes through the flour, the egg and the breadcrumbs (in this order). fry in enough oil (or use a deep fryer) until golden. set on a paper towel to remove excess oil and serve hot."
"directions heat oil in very large pan and saute the garlic, onion, capsicum and tomatoes until soft and browned. add the pork and cook until browned. it is important that you brown the pork to release the flavour. add the sherry, salt (usually a good pinch) and simmer for about 10 minutes stirring occasionally. add the uncooked rice to the pork and stir around to coat. cook for about 3 minutes stirring all the time to prevent from sticking. add water, stock cubes, paprika, peas and saffron powder and stir to even out rice mixture. place calamari and prawns over the top. taste to make sure it has enough salt otherwise with all the rice the dish can taste quite bland. leave to simmer on a medium-low heat for about 20 minutes or until rice is just cooked. do not stir in this process. rice may slightly burn at the bottom but this is common when making this dish. be careful not to overcook rice. when cooked, turn off the heat and let sit for about 5 minutes with a cloth over the top before serving."
