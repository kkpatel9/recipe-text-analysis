"this recipe made it into book#234156!
fabulous!! if i could give this 10 stars, i would. some comments from my family: ""this is delicious"" ; ""i love it"" ; and a two thumbs up because someone was too busy eating to talk. in my opinion, i did not think the recipe was at all difficult or time-consuming to put together. i recommend putting together the sauce and prepping the topping ingredients before starting on the fish. don't skimp on any of the suggested toppings - the combination is what really makes this whole recipe stand out. the sauce is excellent...love it. i used plain greek yogurt (low fat) along with the mayo, jarred chopped garlic & fresh cilantro. other notes: 1. for 4 people, i halved the fish & batter amts. but left the sauce amt. the same - it was perfect. 2. we tried it with both corn and flour tortillas and everyone here voted for the flour tortillas (the corn tasted too dry and was too crumbly for us). 3. cutting the cod into ""index finger size pcs"" is a great recommendation. it seems too small at first, but once dipped in the batter and fried they are plenty big. 4. i used killians irish red beer and loved it. 5. i didn't have mexican oregano so i used italian and it was fine. 6. i used canola oil for frying to make it as healthy as possible. this recipe will be made again and again. so yummy. thank you! ~made for aussie/nz swap~ icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lifeisgood reply 5 this dish is one of the best things i have ever eaten in my life! 10 stars, easy. when i reheated the scant leftovers in the toaster oven this morning, they were so incredibly crispy and delicious. the batter is magic, and works great on zucchini as well. the secret sauce compliments the other flavors perfectly. thank you so much for sharing this recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jane galt37 reply 3 i made these for my son's birthday party since i had invited over a group of huge fish lovers and we were doing a mexican theme.  i prepped these the night before and re-fried the next night so they were hot.  i was afraid no one would touch them since everyone had had so many appetizers, but i couldn't believe how quickly all of them disappeared!  thank you so much for this recipe - it's certainly a keeper! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mona sen reply 3 i made these today. since the recipe said it could be done ahead of time, i figured i'd get a jump on dinner. i couldn't help myself...i had to try one and  it was lunch time. i will agree with everyone else....10 stars! monday is our try "" something new "" day. my family always cringes when i announce a new dish, but usually loves the outcome. we have never tried fish tacos. i can honestly say i can't wait for them to come home for dinner tonight! these were fantastic! i used my own cayenne pepper i grew last summer and had dried. i wish i would have added a bit more of it because mine were not very hot. next time i will double all of the spices in the batter. maybe even add some peppers to the secret sauce. i used tilapia because i had plenty of it. i did cut the fish a bit too big but that will be a easy fix at dinner time after the second frying. overall fantastic!!!!!!!!!! i already know what my family will say at the end of dinner tonight....do over!!!! that is the code for "" way to go mom ""! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal aweebitsilly reply 3 just like a big fish, this recipe is a ""keeper"". i live near the bay in s. texas and we fish a lot. in the summer months, we have a constant stream of visitors every weekend who want to fish, and of course we have to cook the day's catch when we get back. this is one way to cook fish that everyone that has visited loves.(we usually catch speckled trout which is a more delicate fish, but i have no problems with it.) i love it because it's easy to make most of it ahead of time so i spend little time when we come back tired and hungry. just heat the oil, batter the fish and done!<br/>we have lots of seafood restaurants here and i have tried the fish tacos at all of them. this is by far the best i have eaten. the 'secret sauce' is so refreshing and pairs perfectly. thank you cookiedog for posting. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lonestarlori reply 2"
"the original, and how we made it when i bartended in a mexican bar.  though, you should omit the lemon juice part, it must be lime juice. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tjw2725 reply 2 very nice icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tekeve9518 reply 1 this is the classic margarita and its still one of the best, though the amounts are a little off... the recipie as shown makes only 3 ounces, which is tiny. you will have to double all the amounts to fill even a small margarita glass. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kamikazee reply 1 i had my first margarita in mexico city over 30 years ago and that recipe is obviously what they used. i abhor those bar margarita in which they add simple syrup, and other foreign matter. i make them by this recipe every time! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal david w. reply the best margaritas are super simple, just like this one! great as is, and you can make large batches of it for a party--just multiply the ingredients to meet whatever serving you need. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal probably this reply"
"this recipe took me right back to mexico city, where i first had menudo. it's a bit spicy, so feel free to scale back on the peppers if you're sensitive to spicy foods. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal probably this reply 2 this was  o.k.  the only thing that jumps out and grabs you is the pepper heat , yes happy hippi you pre warned me lol, next time i'll use store bought chili powder  and a lot more garlic, thanks for the base recipe icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal toadkiller reply 1 this recipe is great and simple.  i used pressure cooker to speed up the cooking process.  i cooked the tripe twice as directed but i use pressure cooker instead.  it cuts down the cooking process. yummy!! my husband's grandma would have approved!!! thanx! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cili padi reply"
"okay, so it is a lot of steps and a lot of work but it was worth all of the effort! the end result was amazing. seriously the best birria i've ever eaten. it made a lot so i'm going to make quesabirria tacos with the leftovers! can't wait! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jonathan melendez reply 1 yes, a great recipe - but thanks to rick bayless - in his book authentic mexican, published 1987. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stickywicket1 reply 1 it smells so good! but what happened to the next direction after saving the 3/4 cup of soaking liquid from the chiles? also it doesn't say when to add the bay leaves. anyone? icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jac kry reply loved it! dbf is from jalisco and he was impressed. the smell was divine and the next day it made delicious burritos. i used a dutch oven with custard cups and a vegetable steamer since i don't have a roasting pan with a lid and it worked perfectly. thanks again pac baby for sharing your special recipe icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal stephanie y. reply thank you so much for this very tasty recipe - it was right on.  i made it with the goat's meat. the only thing i did not due it pour the tomatoes broth with it. that was changing my flavor when i tested it. now if you can just tell me how to make the salsa that goes on the side, that would have made it perfect... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal scorpioluvstocook reply"
"these were so good! the recipe is a little bit involved as you have to make the meat first in a slow cooker, but totally worth it. i'll definitely make these again. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal probably this reply 1 these are the best!!!! i love them!!! and easy!!! im gonna make them soon!!! :d icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal blueeyes_jd reply"
"moxie, incredible recipe!  incredible!  my husband and i loved it!  he actually said that it was ""the single best thing i've ever made.""  can you believe it?  i've been cooking for him for 14 years, lol! i had to put it away to stop him from eating the whole pan. i did as you suggested and elevated it to sublime using canarygirl's chicken verde, recipe #32918.  this os so esay to make, but the flavor is outstanding.  next time, (and there will be many, many more times making this) he was thinking i should try 2 layers.  i guess he wants more of a good thing, lol!  thanks mox, for sharing this recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ciao4293 reply 6 my family loved this, moxie! we really enjoy these types of casseroles, very comforting and this one has a nice spice from the tomatillo sauce and creaminess from the sour cream. 
i used a whole roasted chicken that i purchased at the local grocer and i really liked the roasted flavor it added and the ease of prep. another keeper, thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal denise! reply 3 we loved this dish for our mexican night with refried beans and rice... my bf loves mexican food b/c it's his excuse to use lots of sour cream so i figured he would love this recipe... i was getting tired of beef soft tacos ( his fave) but really wanted something with lots of spice.  i also used recipe #32918 for the chicken.  it really made the casserole outstanding.  i could not find any green tomatillo sauce in cans so i made up a batch of my own tomatillo chile salsa instead.  i also had to substitute some oaxaca and monterrey jack for the chihuahua cheese since my store was out.  since i was cooking for only 2, i used a square 9x9"" baking dish and just cut down on all the ingredients slightly.  flavors were bright and spicy...not too heavy at all...and so easy to put together.  thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal atlfitgirl reply 2 thanks for the recipe, icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sachin s. reply 1 this recipe was fantastic! my entire family loved it. i used some seasoned pork i had left over from making tamales in place of the chicken and i used pepper jack cheese because that's what i had on hand. my family has already requested that i make this dish again soon. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tunnia reply 1"
"very nice!  tastes like a watermelon soda fixed with club soda.  i had some watermelon that was not so great and decided to try this.  i mixed the watermelon, sugar and lime juice without the water and stored it in the fridge. then when ready to drink it, mix 1part watermelon with 1 part club soda. also found a little extra sugar is good for a less than perfect melon. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chocolatemousse reply 1 a simple and great recipe. agua fresca is super refreshing and amazing for a hot summer day. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal probably this reply i agree that less water should be used if you want a stronger watermelon taste. otherwise, nice and refreshing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cali_love reply this is very good. i'll probably put in a little less water, or a little more watermelon next time since i would like a little stronger watermelon flavour. this is a great alternate for lemonade! made for zwt4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal scarlett516 reply refreshing?  yes!  not sweet.  very mild watermelon flavor.  nice summer drink.  used splenda in place of sugar which worked great.  made for zwt4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal januarybride reply"
"delicious. the whole family enjoyed, including my vegetarian son. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal br2brown reply i've never had enfrijoladas before, and am totally in love with the beans! yum!!! very tasty!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal limeandspoontt reply awesome recipe, i made these with a pot of kidney beans i had boiled and they turned out great.  i think this can be made with any bean. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sophia  mayas mom reply"
"i pretty much make a pot of grains each week to add to soups,have on the side or with a stir fry...i always make long grain brown rice..this works well with that also...i just add a tablespoon of water to the rice and microwave it to heat/steam it...yea and this is great with an egg...and some beans as a complete meal... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ruth e. reply we loved this! such a tasty combo of flavors we never really had together. my husband through a fried egg on top of the leftovers and enjoyed it so much! thanks for the delicious recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply i made this to go with the shrimp i made for dinner last night, and we enjoyed it. i didn't have link chorizo, but i had some ground chorizo. i also forgot to measure out my cooked rice before mixing it in, but i had made my usual size batch of rice (8oz uncooked rice). it may have cooked up to 3 cups after expansion, but i'm not sure. dh was especially happy with this rice, since he's from michoacan. thanks for posting, we'll be using this recipe again for sure! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal muffin goddess reply"
"i'd never come across memelas before but i'm so glad i made them! these are seriously good - the queso fresco was such a nice salty counter to the spicy tomato sauce. these were pretty simple to make as well and i'm sure there are so many possible variations with different toppings. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal izy hossack reply 2 this is an easy and delicious recipe.   i had some as is, some with lettuce, and some with some avocados.  i will do this again and i think i will as well with some refried beans as i think it would be prefect with that and some with avocados or guacamole.  the only thing i changed is that i flattened them with a tortilla press to cut down on the work and time needed to make them.  thanks!  made for zwt 8. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tea girl reply"
"we first sampled this dish (or a version of it) in cabo. your recipe is right on the money as far as we are concerned. we have made it several times to rave reviews and did not change a thing. bravo! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef med reply 2 such a good hearty meal! i liked the idea of adding beans into it, and will definitely try that next time! the spices were perfect, not too spicy, just perfect! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply 1 excellent.  i love molcajete and now i am so excited to be able to make it myself. this recipe is so good.  i used low sodium bullion  and the only other thing i did differently was to double the mushrooms.  thank you for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal carol b. reply different but good! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal brandidt reply this is my husbands ( and everyone else who we have made it for) favorite. we used turkey instead of the beef and turkey bacon . but is is also awesome with the beef and regular bacon. everyone loved it and is asking for the recipe. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jamielemire reply"
"very good icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tanya reply these are fantastic and satisfying, but still light and fresh. i love a recipe that has great balance, and this has a great combo of fatty crunchy goodness along with fresh bright flavors from the salsas and cabbage (if using). this makes a great lunch! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal probably this reply"
"so happy i tried this dish- the unexpected mix of flavors works so well in this bread pudding! we were still picking it at long after dinner was over! thanks for the recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply 3 nanita, your capirotada is so much like my mother's with the exception that she did not use onion. recipes for mexican food are as varied as there are mexicans, many. the recipe that i use has been n with my family for more than 150 years. i really like your idea to cube the bread to toast and butter it.. thank you for your recipe. fantastic, viva la capirotada! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal art g. reply 1 i wasa looking for a capirotada recipe. and found this one, it is the closest to the one my mom used to make. and i plan to surpriser soon. i will let you know what she says. i know she will be shocked to taste this one. she was kinda pusing me to make some. and i told her i would. thanks :-) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal v-rapter reply we enjoyed it. tasted like the one made when i was a little girl. it will now be passed to my 2 grown daughters. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal zoeymom reply i am so glad to find this traditional recipe for capirotada...all the others are nothing more than american bread pudding that some people want to call capirotada!  my family adds chopped tomato to ours as well. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gabesgirl reply"
"this mole sauce is so worth the time and effort, love the depth of flavor! after the sauce was made this was a snap to put together, we froze the leftovers for next time!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply this didn't work for me, probably because i could not find mexican chocolate, and used hershey's natural unsweetened cocoa instead.  i don't blame the recipe.  by all means, do not use hershey chocolate for this recipe; it is incompatible with this recipe.  to sample the sauce, i was glad i had made 1/4 the recipe, because i didn't have room in the freezer for a gallon of mole sauce anyway.  my results were so bad, i was happy to eat leftover shredded chicken from recipe #369106 prepared in a 2-l pressure cooker with 2 large chicken breasts.  i guess i'll order some mexican chocolate through penzeys and try this again.  at least my beefeater tomatoes were from mexico!  i'm sure i was the problem; rick bayless is a great chef!  made for please review my recipe tag game. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal katel reply"
"these little guys are delicious! they are perfect for after school snack for my kiddos when they come home hungry but not yet ready for dinner. also good the next day if you just warm it up for 15 seconds in the microwave! keeping these as a fave! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply 1 i didn't use mennonite salami or cheese, so i don't feel like i can completely be true to rate this recipe.  i used regular sliced hard salami and cheddar/jack cheese.  i tried to get closer to the garlic salami by using garlic crescent rolls, but it just added a weird flavor.  i think this would be better by using the original recipe, or skipping the salami and using ham instead.  made and reviewed for zwt5-rrr. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mulligan reply 1"
always looking for new ways to prepare goat since i don't have it very often. this was flavourful and really easy to make! i served it with rice and beans and was a hit in my house!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal limeandspoontt reply 2 see 1 reply look very good . can't wait to put it together. thanks. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jhgarcia_electrical reply
"such an interesting dessert to make - i had never cooked with guava paste before and i've fallen in love with the flavour! the light fruitiness of the guava was lovely with this flan which had a surprisingly light texture to it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal izy hossack reply 1 beautifully made and a delicious flavor! i followed the recipe exactly!!! the flan itself has perfect texture however i would have preferred it to have a bit more kick of the guava, but that was easily fixed by adding a few guava paste slices on the side! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jlg1306 reply fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal mvelezlaw reply"

awesome! but 4 serrano peppers is a death sentence! dont do it! way to spicy i suggest 2 and i am not a chili light weight. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal angelaemvi reply 3 love this agua chili recipe. i prefer this over regular pico de gallo shrimp cocktail style faster and easier to make and taste just as good if not better. i wouldn't worry about how many peppers are put in you can take the membrane out to make it less hot or leave it in which i do i prefer it hot sour and salty. i like to add tomato just to color it up and the red onion is awesome in this recipe thumbs up icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal patrick p. reply 1 a treat for shrimp lovers. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal kim t. reply loved this recipe. it reminds me of the mexican ceviches i grew up having. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ivansocal reply love this recipe!!!! simply delicious and easy to make. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jessika n. reply
"delicious for a savoury breakfast! served this with mango salsa for a sweet-sour kick. i also pan fried the rolled tortillas so they'd hold together and get a bit crispy. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal izy hossack reply 2 lovely. we used flour tortillas and it made 4 or 5. also used nopalitos from a jar since i don't have access to fresh, and used a large scoop of salsa since i didn't have a fresh tomato. they would probably be good with cheese or chorizo or bacon, but that might defeat the purpose of eating nopalitos (to reduce the risk of diabetes). icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal donut chef reply 1 this is one of my all time favorite breakfasts to eat, as when i was in college, i ate nopalitos and eggs tacos often. it brings back great memories. sometimes, i like to eat it along with fresh seasonal fruit.  thank you for sharing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal blue peacock reply 1 i found this to be a very easy and different dish to make. i've always wanted to try nopalitos, and this was the perfect opportunity. i recommend it highly for those who want to try something different and yet easy to put together. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal bakersfieldmom reply 1 this can serve 4 very easily! i used flour tortillas and added shredded cheese. i thank you for expanding my food for i never had napalitos before. they are mild kinda like okra and green beans. oh i do suggest simmering the tomatoes to remove excess liquid or drain them on a paper towel before adding them to the eggs. thanks!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rita1652 reply 1"
"this soup was wonderful.  i tried to make it a little more healthy - i used low fat breakfast sausage in place of the chorizo and i baked the meatballs first so that any grease would be eliminated from the soup.  i also added a can of black beans, a can of corn and some sliced carrots to the soup when i added the meatballs.  i cut corn tortillas with scissors into long strips, sprayed them with olive oil and baked them until really crisp and served on top.  next time i will top with sliced avocado.  this soup is even better the next day! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cindylou52 reply 13 see 2 replies living in tucson, it's easy to get an incredible bowl of albondigas around every corner. i've made it before but wanted to try something new so chose this recipe because it was ""the best"". the flavor of this soup was amazing and the recipe did not disappoint! yummy!!! i make soups a lot and this is my new favorite soup recipe. the flavor of the chorizo adds everything to the soup. however, living in tucson, our chorizo is quite spicy so my kids couldn't eat the meatballs which was so disappointing for them. they order albondigas whenever they go out. i may do 3 parts beef and 1 part chorizo next time. the other changes i would make: pre-cook the meatballs in the oven to render the fat. the amount of fat at the top of the soup wasn't pretty and i had to skim for a while. i also put in raw rice (which is what i've done before). it saved time and turned out great. i also added 1/2 cup rice to the broth b/c the kids like extra rice. for the adults: top it off with some diced avocado!! this recipe is a keeper!! thanks ruiza! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal c2cooks reply 12 best albondigas soup i have ever eaten. my husband is finicky when it comes to soups, even he had said it is restaurant quality. there is a local mexican restaurant that had very good albondigas soup, this is even better. it was a hit with my family as well. i added 2 lbs of beef to the recipe and added extra chorizo for spiciness. you do need to skim the fat off the top, this is the only downside. if there happens to be any soup left over, you can easily skim off the fat off the top after refrigeration. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal nanabiker2u reply 6 see 1 reply i just made this soup for my family and it was the hit of the evening. i changed the recipe a little to 1lb of beef instead of 1/2lb because the chorizo seemed to be overpowering. however, it came out fantastic! oh and i put carrots in the soup itself too not just in the meatballs. delicious! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal rehannapacheco_1168 reply 6 see 1 reply last night was my very first attempt at making albondigas and it was the best albondigas i've ever had!!!  i followed the recipe for the most part but did make quite a few changes to the ingredients.  the biggest change was instead of using cumin (because i ran out) i ended up using allspice as seasoning.  i omitted the carrots from the meatballs and added it to the soup instead, which turned out great! i also used garlic powder too.  for the vegetables i substituted the zucchini with potato and squash.  i didn't have a can of tomatoes so i diced the tomatoes and tossed them in the soup.  i got a little creative near the end and cooked italian sausage and shrimp in a separate pan and tossed them in too!  everything took about 1.5 hour but it was worth every minute.  two thumbs up!!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chef mayhem reply 6"

thank you. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal braunda reply 6 i think the amount of lime juice took away some of the avacado flavor you expect in a traditional guacamole.  it left my mouth a little dry and tart more than the usual onion and garlic flavors i'd expect.  i'd definitely add less lime next time i make it. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tex6516 reply 5"
"a really flavorful and simple soup to make, almost reminds me of chicken tortilla soup! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal ivansocal reply 1 a lovely spicy soup. i used a ripe jalapeno, as that was what i had. instead of frying tortillas, i used some tortilla strips that were intended for salads, but worked well here. also, i just forgot the avocado (which then made a nice sandwich for me). also, i used some turkey meatballs that i made during a meatball marathon a couple of days ago, and those worked just great. i reduced the recipe a bit to use three cups of broth, which was right for us for two servings, we really enjoyed this soup on this very cold night. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal duonyte reply 1 this soup is bursting with flavours and yet light and spicy. wondeful for a cool evening! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal deantini reply so delicious... spicy and tangy, but light and filling.  wonderful blend of flavors.  thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal starrynews reply"

"just tried with champagne. tentatively calling it a meximosa icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal julian e. reply 3 so delicious and refreshing! this was easier to make than i thought, will be making this all summer long!! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal frostingnfettuccine reply 1 i have a big jug of this in my refrigerator right now! processing the tamarind pods to get the smooth pulp is pretty labor-intensive (a bit moreso than making fresh-squeezed lemonade from scratch, imo), but it's definitely worth it in the end. i wasn't sure if the amount of tamarind pulp in the recipe was equal to the weight of the unprocessed pods, so i went nuts and ended up with about 4.5 cups of tamarind pulp to work with. rather than add dry sugar to the mix, i made simple syrup (2 cups water and 2 cups sugar, cooked over low heat until dissolved and clear). i ended up with about 2 gallons of fairly strong agua de tamarindo, so i've been diluting it a bit with ice water as it's served (most agua frescas i've tried have been more watery, but i didn't have a big enough jug to dilute it down quite enough at the time). i guess what i'm trying to say is that i complicated the recipe more that it should have been, but i really like the drink anyway -- it's a nice change from lemonade every so often (and it garners brownie points from my dh, too!). thanks, mexi-rosie! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal muffin goddess reply see 3 replies"

yummie! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lesliecoy reply 5 oh, yummy!  thanks for the detailed instructions, they made it quite easy.  funny, it never dawned on me to make my own tortillas until i spotted a metal tortilla press for sale on a very top shelf at rancho market.  i have made them twice now, and found that the addition of about 1/8 t. to 1/4 t. of xanthan gum to the flour makes them a little less likely to disintegrate.  there really is no comparison with the store bought ones.  these are tender and chewy, rather than stiff and dry.  i can't wait to have one with mashed pintos and tabasco for dinner tonight. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal erin r. reply 3 see 1 reply i love homemade tortillas and do not have a press so i take a piece of saran wrap (big enough to place under and over a reg.size tortilla) place my small ball of masa in the center fold over the saran wrap and press down with the bottom of a dinner plate....works for me! even and round..... icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jennifer 1979 reply 2 i never buy tortillas at the store any more. you can also add a little taco seasoning or cumin and chili powder with salt. i use the press and press between two ziploc bags. i also use a large electric griddle for cooking them. i put two down, make another, flip the first, make another, flip the next. they can dry out if they are kept warm in an oven, so what i do is just stack them on the end, but instead of putting the new tortilla on top, i put the new one on the bottom. the steam coming up from that one keeps them all perfectly moist. you can skip the wax paper with a griddle because you cook up more than one at a time (i do six small ones). icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal msteechur reply 1 this is pretty much the recipe from the masaca bag, but less water. i like it a bit dry because it's easier to roll and peel. i like to roll on a masa dusted silicon baking mat and use half a zip-top bag on the top (mexico style). i roll exclusively with a wine bottle. great variation is to substitute 30% wheat flour (#118085). can also be made with pan from venezuela -- a precooked corn meal, that is not soaked in cal/slacked lime. increase the water to 1:1. pan tortillas are a bit tender and crumbly -- add flour for strength. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal i and s reply 1"

"if you like to make home made jam and have the patience for it, then this is the type of recipe for you.  i advise you to not undertake this project without a heat proof ""rubber"" spatula and a non stick sauce pan.  i cut the recipe in half, and it was just fine.  stage one seemed to go on forever, but it finally reached a ""sort-of"" golden color.  i gently stirred in the boiled milk as directed, and then let the mixture slowly cook on very low heat.  the cajeta begins to turn golden and you will know when it’s ready when it is a nice rolling mass of bubbles - like jam...it will sort of drip off the spatula and begin to thicken as it drips when it is done.  the caramel color seemed to intensify as it cooled.  be patient, follow the directions and enjoy the fruit of your labor. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal justcallmejulie reply 1 cajeta is so yummy. i made it yesterday for the first time. i just wanted to add that if you use highly pasteurized goat's milk (available at whole foods and kroger) it doesn't take as long to make (about and hour or so), it is only towards the end that you have to stand right there and stir constantly (although i am nearby all of the time) and goat's milk doesn't burn as easily as cow's milk. i also didn't separate the milk out. just put sugar, milk, baking soda and vanilla bean in the heavy (large) pot and started heating it up. turned out great! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal terri w. reply as has been said this recipe does take a long time to make.  it is well worth the effort though!

"another fabulous recipe from mama's kitchen! i doubled the recipe but not the number of poblanos since i was feeding 5 adults and 3 kids ages 4 to 80. cooked my chicken in the crock pot all dayand so used the broth from cooking my chicken in the sauce instead of water. i used freshly made corn tortillas from the market up the street so i didn't need to fry the tortillas in oil because they were already so soft and pliable. i didn't realize until i got the enchiladas rolled and in the pan covered in sauce that you didn't bake them and i hadn't started my rice which takes 20 minutes to cook. so i just popped the enchilada pans in the oven at 350 for time it took to make the rice. everyone gobbled these enchiladas up including the kids. while my husband was watching me make the sauce he thought adding flour tortillas to the blender was really unusual but the flavor...... awsome! thanks again hope for another of you fantastic recipes that we will have over and over! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal sooz cooks reply 1 i haven't eaten a corn tortilla since i was a kid.  i have never liked them so i was really surprised at how much we all enjoyed them in this recipe. we love enchiladas but have been making the same chicken or beef recipes for years.  we're thrilled to have found a new & exciting recipe for them!  i really wanted to make everything as stated but the two grocery stores in our area did not have poblanos, fresh or canned.  i was distraught & waited another 3 days to see if the fresh peppers would be restocked but they are still out today.  i looked online & found some substitution suggestions.  in one it was suggested to use a jalapeno & a green bell pepper.  well, i had the jalapenos but only about 1/4 of the green bell so i used those plus half a red & half an orange pepper.  i know the sauce was much sweeter than intended (and much more orange lol) but we enjoyed it & are anxious to make this recipe again with the poblanos, when possible.  i have to say that my favorite part of this recipe was how easy it was.  i loved that there was no oven time involved.  especially with summer on the way.  thanks for sharing a little piece of the big state, mama!  made & enjoyed for zwt5 - ali baba's babes.  :) icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal tinkerbell reply 1 this was really good...our only big complaint was that we used tortillas that were too big - tasted more tortilla than i would have liked it to...

added a bit too much water to the sauce - was halving the recipe and didn't catch the 1 cup of water on the 2nd page to change to 1/2.

of course i love citrus, so i knew i'd like this. ground, mexican oregano makes any mexican or southwestern dish better, lends a wonderful smoky flavor, very unlike regular oregano as we think of it in italian food. the first time i identified it at a mexican restaurant, i spent the whole time trying to pinpoint the wonderful smoky, earthy flavor that i was tasting, once i figured it out, i made sure i always have it on hand for my mexican food cooking. sorry, kind of got on an oregano tangent lol. funny thing is, i am not crazy about regular oregano in italian food, i miss it if it's not there, but somehow it's just different. needless to say, i added a little more oregano than 1 t to this recipe lol ;o)
thanks~! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal yrhaven aka condime reply we loved the flavors in this.  i used this on chicken legs and thighs and marinaded for about 7 hours.  will have to try it on pork or fish next time.  thanks cookiedog! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal culinaryqueen reply"
"interesting dish that i wanted to try for the unique ingredients! i followed exactly, but the sauce didn't have as much flavor as i wanted, so i added some garlic, onion and cilantro, then cooked it down a bit. adding water to thin it out. i liked the use of chopped hard-boiled eggs as a filling, and it definitely worked with the sauce and chiltomate. as the sauce cooled, it kept thickening up, so my photo isn't that great - sorry! made for cq4. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal jostlori reply 1"
"thank you! our strawberries are unpleasantly mushy this year and this was a great way to put them to use anyway. didn't expect it to taste so ... fresh, but it is really yummy and really refreshing. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal marie b. reply so refreshing!  i used stevia instead of sugar and added a little extra lime because i like tartness.  my boyfriend added rum to his :)  i'll try this with other fruit as well!  thanks! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal canadian in atlanta reply really good! i strained it a bit to remove most of the seeds and pulp. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal cheeky meeks reply i wanted something different than tea or water and i'm not big on real sweet things, so i did this with some fresh berry mix i had from the store. strawberries mostly with a few bluberries and blackberries and kiwi. about 3/4 a cup, 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 cup water and a squeeze of lemon i had in the fridge. blended over ice. it's delicious. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chupie reply very easy, very refreshing drink. first time i made it i used lime juice concertrate, i dont reccomend that and i decided i better try it the right way before reviewing. the trip to the market for a fresh lime is worth it, this is a tastey drink. i also threw in some ice for part of the water the second time around. the result was a sweet slightly slushlie drink, very nice, will try this again. made for bev tag icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal michelle_my_belle reply"
"ohhhh my lordy!!!!! i just made a batch of chamoy with this recipe and i could drink the whole bottle (but i'm pretty sure i would be sick). can wait to use this for some fritos locos. fritos covered with shredded cucumbers and radishes, topped with chamoy, lime juice and tajin seasoning. this recipe is like candy!! thank you! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal chrissyespinosa reply intriguing, i had to try this!  mine turned out only slightly spicy, and the recipe yielded 2 3/4 fl. cups.  this made recipe#483119 look like a sundae, which you will love if you love mango.  found my dried ancho chiles at a mexican grocer.  thanks for sharing this recipe, jositori.  made for the wild bunch for zwt8's visit to mexico. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal katel reply"
"this was really good. :yummy: mine doesn't look as pretty though. i expect because my slices weren't uniform, but i doubt it made any difference to the taste. oh...i also threw in some peppercorms...just a few. these went really well with the recipe #222371 we had tonight. thanks for a great recipe. *update* aug 23/08 made again today.  actually, i probably make this every second month or so.  this is always in my fridge.  such a terrific recipe.  everyone should give it a try.  i was a little disappointed that it can't be 'canned', but it's so easy and quick to make it really isn't a bother at all.  this time i added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 15 grinds from the pepper mill!  thanks again juenessa icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal diana 2 reply 2 these are really good. i added 1/4 tsp each whole peppercorns and red pepper flakes (could use more!) had on a salad last night and can't wait to try on a burger! thanks for sharing! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal flower7 reply 1 these are wonderful and so easy to make! i did toss in a few crushed red pepper flakes to satisfy our craving for heat.  right after they cooled, i made a sandwich of your recipe #213870 and topped it with these onions.  super! these will find a permanent home in my fridge.  thanks for sharing your recipe! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal susiequsie reply 1 this recipe is so easy and they taste great, the jar didn't last a week at my house. icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal lundelldt reply what a great way to serve this wonderful vegetable! the onions are delicately flavourful and very pretty. dh had his as a side with baked chicken legs, and insisted that there always be a jar in the fridge. i had mine with baked chicken breast, but added a dollop of sour cream and lots of fresh ground black pepper. thank you for a real taste treat. can hardly wait to try them on a corned beef or liverwurst sandwich! icons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal gwen35 reply"
